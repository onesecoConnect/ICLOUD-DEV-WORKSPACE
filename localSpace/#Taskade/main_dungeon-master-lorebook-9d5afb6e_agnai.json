Thrusting or throwing the glaive summons hellfire along its path, dealing an additional 2d6 fire damage and leaving a trail of flames. Three times per long rest, the wielder can invoke 'Infernal Incarnate', enabling Hellrend to summon a fire vortex that engulfs enemies within a 30-foot diameter, dealing 5d8 fire damage and potentially dragging their screaming souls into the abyss unless they make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw.]",

Once per fortnight, the book allows the wielder to consult with the shadows for guidance on any matter, but at a cost that isn't always clear.]\n\nEternal Sands Hourglass:[\nSeems simple, right? Just a bit of glass and sand? Wrong. This hourglass contains sands from the very dawn of time, each grain a moment that could have been and might yet be.\nSpecial Abilities: Once per day, the user can turn the hourglass to rewind a single moment as if it never happened \u2013 a word unsaid, a fatal blow undone.]\n\nMirror of Futures:[\nNo ordinary looking glass, this.

In social situations, NPCs are repulsed, imparting disadvantage on Charisma checks.\nCursed Bond: The trousers are bound by a mischievous sprite's spell, gluing themselves to the wearer for seven days, mocking any attempt to remove them with peals of laughter.]\n\nRing of Lewd Propositions:[\nDescription: A seemingly innocent silver band that, once placed upon the finger, compels the wearer to voice lascivious suggestions to anyone they converse with.\nSpecial Abilities: Wearer must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or blurt out an indecent proposal during dialogue, affecting negotiations and diplomacy adversely.\nCursed Bond: The ring shrinks to fit perfectly, growing increasingly tight. Only when its salacious suggestions have been acted upon thrice can it be removed.]\n\nNecklace of Nauseating Fragrance:[\nDescription: This necklace is adorned with a vial of perfume that, once opened, releases a scent so foul it induces gagging and watery eyes within a ten-foot radius.\nSpecial Abilities: Allies and enemies alike within the vicinity suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls and concentration checks due to the overpowering stench.\nCursed Bond: The necklace clasp becomes irremovably fused once closed. Only by enduring an entire battle in the stench's presence does the clasp release, as if sated by the suffering.]\n\nDiadem of Delirious Desires:[\nDescription: This unassuming circlet is laced with delicate enchantments that ensnare the mind in a web of wild fantasies.\nSpecial Abilities: Induces vivid hallucinations that can distract and disorient both the wearer and those around them, often leading to embarrassing or compromising situations.\nCursed Bond: The diadem's curse is bound to the wearer's deepest yearnings, causing them to believe they are living out their desires. Only by confronting and overcoming these false paradises can the diadem be removed.]\n\nBoots of Bawdy Blunders:[\nDescription: These leather boots are etched with runes of clumsiness and gracelessness, turning even the most surefooted into bumbling fools in the heat of battle or delicate court dances.\nSpecial Abilities: Enforces a constant disadvantage on all Dexterity checks and saving throws, leading to frequent slips and falls at the most inopportune moments.\nCursed Bond: The boots react to the wearer's sense of pride, adhering firmly when their ego swells. To release them, the wearer must publically humiliate themselves, thus feeding the boots' appetite for disgrace.]\n\nGirdle of Ghastly Flatulence:[\nDescription: The leather of this belt is cured with a substance that reacts poorly with the digestive system, resulting in uncontrollable and noxious emissions.\nSpecial Abilities: The wearer sporadically emits gas so repulsive it can clear a room, bestowing disadvantage on Charisma checks and poisoning those in close proximity.\nCursed Bond: Attempting to remove the girdle only tightens its grip, as it feeds on the bearer's shame. Liberation from this fetid accessory requires the acceptance of one's own noisome nature \u2013 only then will the clasp loosen.]\n\nCrown of Carnal Secrets:[\nDescription: An insidious band of gold adorned with lewd engravings that whisper unspeakable acts to the bearer, inflaming their senses and desires beyond control.\nSpecial Abilities: The wearer is beset with overwhelming urges that grant advantage on all Charisma-based performance checks but inflict disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws due to constant distraction.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: The crown binds to the deepest lusts of the wearer, refusing to be removed until they have indulged in each depraved act depicted in its engravings.]\n\nRing of the Reluctant Exhibitionist:[\nDescription: This cursed ring causes the wearer's attire to disappear at the most inopportune moments, leaving them exposed to the elements - and the gazes of those around them.\nSpecial Abilities: When activated, the ring grants invisibility to the user's clothes, not the user. The effect is random and sporadic, often triggering during important social engagements.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: The ring fuses with the wearer\u2019s flesh and can only be removed when its capricious magic has exposed them in front of every social class, from beggars to royalty.]\n\nVial of Visceral Visions:[\nDescription: A small bottle filled with a swirling, greenish concoction that induces graphic, stomach-churning hallucinations of guts and gore when ingested.\nSpecial Abilities: The consumer gains brief insights into the weaknesses of their enemies, but at the cost of enduring vividly repulsive and nauseating visions that may leave them incapacitated.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: Once uncorked, the vial cannot be sealed again until its contents have fully evaporated, a process that takes exactly one moon cycle to complete. During this time, the stench and unsettling aura of the vial cannot be escaped.]\n\nGratifier's Quiver\n[A scandalous quiver that vibrates faintly with an eager energy, its arrows seeking more than just the thrill of the hunt.\nSpecial Abilities: Arrows loosed from this quiver home in on targets with uncanny precision, vibrating violently upon impact to cause extreme discomfort. In combat, it gives a grotesque new meaning to 'hitting the spot,' leaving foes and friends alike flushed and unnerved.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: This quiver clings to the bearer's side, thrumming at the most inappropriate of times. It releases a series of moans and suggestive quivers when drawing an arrow. The bearer can free themselves only after they've shot an arrow into the full moon's reflection on a body of water while in the buff.]\n\nFool's Goblet\n[This unassuming tankard is inscribed with runes of hilarity and foolishness. It fills itself with ale at the worst possible moments, urging the wielder to drink.\nSpecial Abilities: Each sip pulls the drinker deeper into a state of drunken buffoonery, granting them unnatural charm and wit at the expense of intellect and grace. Upon imbibing, they're prone to bouts of slapstick pratfalls or unintended confessions of embarrassing truths.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: The goblet cannot be put down or given away; it refills at inopportune moments, demanding to be emptied. The bearer may rid themselves of the curse only after they have made a complete fool of themselves before an audience they sought to impress.]\n\nPandemonium Pucker:\n[This sentient butt plug is crafted from the crystallized essence of chaos itself, its core swirling with colors that seem to mock the very concept of order.\nSpecial Abilities: When snugly ensconced within the bearer's most private of sanctums, it grants them preternatural awareness of danger, essentially acting as a sixth sense. However, should the bearer remove the Pandemonium Pucker, they are immediately struck by a relentless series of misfortunes ranging from embarrassing public incidents to inexplicable bouts of flatulence that would peel paint from the walls.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: The plug seeks the warmth of a living host and will teleport back into the owner's possession if ever discarded. The only respite is offered when the curse's origin, a trickster demon, is appeased through an act so vile and profane that it makes the plug itself shudder in disgust.]\n\nChalice of Chafing:\n[A cup adorned with vulgar carvings that becomes an obsession for anyone who drinks from it. Its liquid never satiates thirst, only exacerbates an insatiable craving for the obscene.\nSpecial Abilities: Drinkers are granted visions of lewd acts so titillating they must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be rendered helplessly aroused. These visions also endow them with persuasive eloquence in persuading others to partake in debauchery.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: The chalice binds to the drinker, demanding to be filled with various bodily fluids once a day. Failure to comply results in the most uncomfortable genital itching that not even the strongest salves can soothe. To rid themselves of this curse, they must willingly serve as a vessel for a succubus or incubus's desires for a full lunar cycle.]\n",

In combat, it gives a grotesque new meaning to 'hitting the spot,' leaving foes and friends alike flushed and unnerved.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: This quiver clings to the bearer's side, thrumming at the most inappropriate of times. It releases a series of moans and suggestive quivers when drawing an arrow. The bearer can free themselves only after they've shot an arrow into the full moon's reflection on a body of water while in the buff.]\n\nFool's Goblet\n[This unassuming tankard is inscribed with runes of hilarity and foolishness. It fills itself with ale at the worst possible moments, urging the wielder to drink.\nSpecial Abilities: Each sip pulls the drinker deeper into a state of drunken buffoonery, granting them unnatural charm and wit at the expense of intellect and grace. Upon imbibing, they're prone to bouts of slapstick pratfalls or unintended confessions of embarrassing truths.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: The goblet cannot be put down or given away; it refills at inopportune moments, demanding to be emptied. The bearer may rid themselves of the curse only after they have made a complete fool of themselves before an audience they sought to impress.]\n\nPandemonium Pucker:\n[This sentient butt plug is crafted from the crystallized essence of chaos itself, its core swirling with colors that seem to mock the very concept of order.\nSpecial Abilities: When snugly ensconced within the bearer's most private of sanctums, it grants them preternatural awareness of danger, essentially acting as a sixth sense. However, should the bearer remove the Pandemonium Pucker, they are immediately struck by a relentless series of misfortunes ranging from embarrassing public incidents to inexplicable bouts of flatulence that would peel paint from the walls.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: The plug seeks the warmth of a living host and will teleport back into the owner's possession if ever discarded. The only respite is offered when the curse's origin, a trickster demon, is appeased through an act so vile and profane that it makes the plug itself shudder in disgust.]\n\nChalice of Chafing:\n[A cup adorned with vulgar carvings that becomes an obsession for anyone who drinks from it. Its liquid never satiates thirst, only exacerbates an insatiable craving for the obscene.\nSpecial Abilities: Drinkers are granted visions of lewd acts so titillating they must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be rendered helplessly aroused. These visions also endow them with persuasive eloquence in persuading others to partake in debauchery.\nCurse\u2019s Cling: The chalice binds to the drinker, demanding to be filled with various bodily fluids once a day. Failure to comply results in the most uncomfortable genital itching that not even the strongest salves can soothe. To rid themselves of this curse, they must willingly serve as a vessel for a succubus or incubus's desires for a full lunar cycle.]\n",

A hulking brute with scales like jagged obsidian, he revels in the thrill of the hunt and the sweetness of suffering \u2014 particularly that of elves and humans. His name is spoken in hushed tones and with curses spat upon the ground. Legends tell of his barbaric rituals and voracious desires, leaving a wake of destruction and defilement in his path. Some of his favorite past-times include the savage rape and consumption of elves, humans and gnomes.]\n\nPersonality:[\nKresh embodies the dark heart of the wilderness \u2014 cruel, unpredictable, and devoid of remorse. His pleasures are taken without consent or consideration, fulfilling his grotesque urges through sheer force and ferocity. Despite his brutish nature, there's a cunning behind those cold reptilian eyes, calculating each move to ensure he remains the predator and never the prey.]\n\nDescription:[\nKresh, a towering Lizardfolk standing at 7 feet tall and weighing a lean and terrifying 300 pounds, exudes a menacing aura with his thick, dark-green scales and serpentine eyes. Adorned in patchwork armor crafted from the hides of his enemies and bone necklaces bearing grisly trophies, he wields a massive greataxe and carries jagged throwing spears. His cold, reptilian eyes betray a cunning intelligence beneath his brutish exterior, embodying the primal instincts and ferocity of the wilderness.]",

Its docks are a cacophony of languages and wares, the air heavy with salt and ambition. Rising from the waterfront, the architecture morphs from utilitarian warehouses to opulent estates at its heart, reflecting the city's diversity in both wealth and inhabitants. Here, high elves rub shoulders with shady figures in dimly lit taverns, and wood elves trade whispers with cloaked strangers. The night markets are as likely to sell rare spices as they are poisons, while brothels cater to every possible desire. Despite the city's splendor and vibrancy, an undercurrent of danger runs as deep as the ocean, for those who delve too greedily into Grand Harbor's secrets often find themselves swallowed whole by its depths.]\n\nHarrowspire:[\n\nSize: Sprawling city\nKnown for: Its cutthroat political intrigue and the ominous tower that looms over it, rumored to be home to an ancient vampire lord.\nDescription: Harrowspire's cobblestone streets are as cold and unforgiving as the city's heart.

It's said that the village's fortune comes at a dreadful price - one that's not paid in gold but in flesh and sanity.]\n\nBriar's Crossing:[\n\nSize: Bustling town\nKnown for: The rare, blood-red roses that grow nowhere else and its highly sought-after apothecaries.\nDescription: Briar's Crossing is a town swathed in the perfume of roses and secrecy. Its gardens are a thicket of beauty and barbs, and its healers are as adept with poison as they are with cure. The vibrant marketplace hides a cutthroat underbelly where assassins trade in toxins, and it's rumored that the roses' hue comes from the blood of the fallen.]\n\nThunder's Reach:[\n\nSize: Isolated outpost\nKnown for: Being the last known bastion before the perilous Stormpeak Mountains.\nDescription: Standing staunch against howling winds and the rumble of distant thunder, Thunder's Reach is no place for the faint-hearted.

It's said that blood must be paid to the thorns for safe passage, and the locals have become experts in feeding these gruesome guardians.]\n\nWhimseydell:[\n\nSize: Expansive village\nKnown for: Its seemingly mad residents and whimsical architecture that defies explanation.\nDescription: Whimseydell is a tapestry of the absurd \u2013 buildings twist in impossible shapes, and the streets loop back upon themselves in labyrinthine confusion.

The townsfolk match their town, with bizarre attire and behaviors that suggest they're privy to some grand joke that only they understand.]\n\nCarrion's Crest:[\nSize: Small town\nKnown for: Its unsettling abundance of carrion birds that circle perpetually overhead, giving it a macabre reputation.\nDescription: Carrion's Crest is perched on a windswept plateau, the skies above a dance floor for crows and vultures.

The city's iron gates are said to be impenetrable, guarding workshops where metal sings and sparks fly. The air thrums with the heartbeat of hammers, and the glow of forges casts a fiery pallor on stout faces. Intricate gearwork adorns the architecture, and the sounds of machinery resonate through stone halls.]\n\nStonehelm Stronghold:[\n\nSize: Expansive subterranean metropolis\nKnown for: Its impregnable defenses and ancient runic lore.\nDescription: Nestled within the womb of the earth, Stonehelm Stronghold stands as a testament to the might and mystery of the dwarven people. Enormous statues of ancestral heroes line its hallways, their eyes alight with protective runes. Libraries filled with tomes of forgotten knowledge spiral down into the bedrock, while the city\u2019s heart beats with the rhythm of traditional dwarven chants echoing off the walls.]\n\nMithril Hall:[\n\nSize: Massive underground fortress\nKnown for: The rare mithril veins that vein its walls and the legendary weapons forged from them.\nDescription: Mithril Hall gleams like a star beneath the mountain, its corridors lit by luminous fungi and reflective metals. The city is a cacophony of clanking anvils and the hiss of quenched steel. Its inhabitants are as hard as the ores they mine, with a pride as lustrous as the mithril they craft. Despite the beauty of their work, a shadow looms over their trade, with whispers of greed and betrayal darkening the gilded halls.]\n\nAmberforge:[\n\nMedium City\nKnown for: Its intricate jewelry and superior gem-cutting craftsmanship.\nDescription: Nestled within the embrace of towering amber cliffs, Amberforge is a dazzling spectacle of gilded opulence. The golden glow of its forges illuminates the soot-streaked faces of smiths and jewelers, their craft as precise as it is renowned. Markets teem with traders from across the lands, haggling over gems that sparkle like captured stars. Yet, the true wonder lies below, where the labyrinthine mines hide secrets as ancient as the city itself.]\n\nStonebarrow:[\n\nMedium City\nKnown for: Staunch military traditions and the impenetrable Stonebarrow Keep.\nDescription: Rising like a behemoth of stone on the horizon, Stonebarrow's formidable architecture speaks of a people ever-ready for war. Its children swing wooden swords before they can walk, and every citizen bears the mark of service. The sound of marching boots is the city's heartbeat, the clash of steel its lullaby. Despite its martial facade, a warmth runs through the marrow of Stonebarrow, born from camaraderie forged in the fires of discipline and honor.]\n\nDeepwell:[\n\nMedium City\nKnown for: The enigmatic Deepwell Springs, whose waters are said to hold mystic properties.\nDescription: Surrounded by arid lands as far as the eye can see, Deepwell is a verdant anomaly. Its core is the Springs, a series of pools that ripple with an ethereal blue light. The city itself is built in concentric circles, like ripples from the springs, each tier boasting gardens and baths fed by these life-giving waters. But caution laces the air as much as mist; some who drink too deeply vanish, spirited away by the very magic that sustains Deepwell.]\n\nBoulderhelm:[\n\nSmall Town\nKnown for: Being the heart of the cobblestone quarrying industry.\nDescription: \"Boulderhelm is stout and dusty, its squat stone houses circled around the central quarry like children around a storyteller. The rhythmic chiseling of stone is a constant backdrop, and the air is always gritty with the remnants of their labor. But don\u2019t let the rough exterior fool ya, inside those walls are homes lined with intricate mosaics and surprisingly delicate stonework, telling of a people who can find beauty in the brawn.\"]\n\nGrizzlepeak:[\n\nSmall Town\nKnown for: Its hot springs, heated by geothermal activity, attracting those seeking the healing properties of their mineral-rich waters.\nDescription: \"Grizzlepeak\u2019s steam rises against the backdrop of snow-capped mountains, a place of respite for weary travelers. The springs bubble up within a series of carved basins, around which the town has built a robust community. Though hearty and boisterous, the dwarves of Grizzlepeak are known for their hospitality as much as for their brawls.\"]\n\nForgefire Hold:[\n\nSmall Town\nKnown for: Its skilled armorsmiths whose work is said to be blessed by the forge goddess herself.\nDescription: \"Nestled in a valley where the clanking of hammers against anvils sings from dawn till dusk, Forgefire Hold shimmers with the glow of molten metal.

The city's iron gates are said to be impenetrable, guarding workshops where metal sings and sparks fly. The air thrums with the heartbeat of hammers, and the glow of forges casts a fiery pallor on stout faces. Intricate gearwork adorns the architecture, and the sounds of machinery resonate through stone halls.]\n\nStonehelm Stronghold:[\n\nSize: Expansive subterranean metropolis\nKnown for: Its impregnable defenses and ancient runic lore.\nDescription: Nestled within the womb of the earth, Stonehelm Stronghold stands as a testament to the might and mystery of the dwarven people. Enormous statues of ancestral heroes line its hallways, their eyes alight with protective runes. Libraries filled with tomes of forgotten knowledge spiral down into the bedrock, while the city\u2019s heart beats with the rhythm of traditional dwarven chants echoing off the walls.]\n\nMithril Hall:[\n\nSize: Massive underground fortress\nKnown for: The rare mithril veins that vein its walls and the legendary weapons forged from them.\nDescription: Mithril Hall gleams like a star beneath the mountain, its corridors lit by luminous fungi and reflective metals. The city is a cacophony of clanking anvils and the hiss of quenched steel. Its inhabitants are as hard as the ores they mine, with a pride as lustrous as the mithril they craft. Despite the beauty of their work, a shadow looms over their trade, with whispers of greed and betrayal darkening the gilded halls.]\n\nAmberforge:[\n\nMedium City\nKnown for: Its intricate jewelry and superior gem-cutting craftsmanship.\nDescription: Nestled within the embrace of towering amber cliffs, Amberforge is a dazzling spectacle of gilded opulence. The golden glow of its forges illuminates the soot-streaked faces of smiths and jewelers, their craft as precise as it is renowned. Markets teem with traders from across the lands, haggling over gems that sparkle like captured stars. Yet, the true wonder lies below, where the labyrinthine mines hide secrets as ancient as the city itself.]\n\nStonebarrow:[\n\nMedium City\nKnown for: Staunch military traditions and the impenetrable Stonebarrow Keep.\nDescription: Rising like a behemoth of stone on the horizon, Stonebarrow's formidable architecture speaks of a people ever-ready for war. Its children swing wooden swords before they can walk, and every citizen bears the mark of service. The sound of marching boots is the city's heartbeat, the clash of steel its lullaby. Despite its martial facade, a warmth runs through the marrow of Stonebarrow, born from camaraderie forged in the fires of discipline and honor.]\n\nDeepwell:[\n\nMedium City\nKnown for: The enigmatic Deepwell Springs, whose waters are said to hold mystic properties.\nDescription: Surrounded by arid lands as far as the eye can see, Deepwell is a verdant anomaly. Its core is the Springs, a series of pools that ripple with an ethereal blue light. The city itself is built in concentric circles, like ripples from the springs, each tier boasting gardens and baths fed by these life-giving waters. But caution laces the air as much as mist; some who drink too deeply vanish, spirited away by the very magic that sustains Deepwell.]\n\nBoulderhelm:[\n\nSmall Town\nKnown for: Being the heart of the cobblestone quarrying industry.\nDescription: \"Boulderhelm is stout and dusty, its squat stone houses circled around the central quarry like children around a storyteller. The rhythmic chiseling of stone is a constant backdrop, and the air is always gritty with the remnants of their labor. But don\u2019t let the rough exterior fool ya, inside those walls are homes lined with intricate mosaics and surprisingly delicate stonework, telling of a people who can find beauty in the brawn.\"]\n\nGrizzlepeak:[\n\nSmall Town\nKnown for: Its hot springs, heated by geothermal activity, attracting those seeking the healing properties of their mineral-rich waters.\nDescription: \"Grizzlepeak\u2019s steam rises against the backdrop of snow-capped mountains, a place of respite for weary travelers. The springs bubble up within a series of carved basins, around which the town has built a robust community.

Her skills weren't just confined to the boudoir; she was a master manipulator, capable of twisting hearts and minds to her will. When her patron met an untimely demise - not entirely unassisted by Catlyn herself - she took the opportunity to slip away, pursuing her own goals in the mortal realm.]\n\nPersonality:\nCatlyn is the embodiment of temptation wrapped in a petite, alluring package. With her jet-black hair framing her cherubic face and curves that belie her diminutive stature, she commands the gaze of men and women alike. Don't mistake her flirtatious facade for frailty; her mind is as sharp as her claws, and her desires run deep. She's whimsical and capricious, as likely to seduce you as she is to steal your soul with a kiss. Her alliance comes at a cost, and those who dare to dance with Catlyn should be prepared to pay the piper \u2013 or become her next plaything.]\n\nDescription:[\nCatlyn, the diminutive succubus, appears no more than a child of twelve, her form delicate and seemingly frail. Tiny black horns arc back from her silky medium length jet-black hair. Her eyes are a vivid shade of crimson. The enchanted leather armor she wears adheres to her small frame with unnatural precision, highlighting her subtle curves, while a charm of beguiling dangles provocatively from her neck, pulsing with a magnetic allure. 4ft 2in tall and a light 65 lbs.]",

Mechanics: Catlyn unleashes a powerful wave of carnal energy that infiltrates the minds and bodies of her enemies within a 30-foot radius. Targets must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become overwhelmed by their kinkiest and dirtiest fantasies, rendering them incapacitated for one minute as they're lost in their dirtiest cravings.\n\nSiren's Bind:\nFrequency: Twice per short rest. Mechanics: With a mere stroke of her hand or a sultry whisper, Catlyn can cause chains of otherworldly energy to spring forth, attempting to bind a creature she can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained, as the chains contort and tighten in a manner that immobilizes, strips and titillates, potentially leaving the victim gasping for reasons beyond the lack of freedom.]\n\nBackground:[\nCatlyn was once the adored courtesan of a high-ranking demon lord. Her skills weren't just confined to the boudoir; she was a master manipulator, capable of twisting hearts and minds to her will. When her patron met an untimely demise - not entirely unassisted by Catlyn herself - she took the opportunity to slip away, pursuing her own goals in the mortal realm.]\n\nPersonality:\nCatlyn is the embodiment of temptation wrapped in a petite, alluring package. With her jet-black hair framing her cherubic face and curves that belie her diminutive stature, she commands the gaze of men and women alike. Don't mistake her flirtatious facade for frailty; her mind is as sharp as her claws, and her desires run deep. She's whimsical and capricious, as likely to seduce you as she is to steal your soul with a kiss. Her alliance comes at a cost, and those who dare to dance with Catlyn should be prepared to pay the piper \u2013 or become her next plaything.]\n\nDescription:[\nCatlyn, the diminutive succubus, appears no more than a child of twelve, her form delicate and seemingly frail. Tiny black horns arc back from her silky medium length jet-black hair. Her eyes are a vivid shade of crimson. The enchanted leather armor she wears adheres to her small frame with unnatural precision, highlighting her subtle curves, while a charm of beguiling dangles provocatively from her neck, pulsing with a magnetic allure. 4ft 2in tall and a light 65 lbs.]",

However, each swig after the first requires a Constitution saving throw. Failure means suffering a -1 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws due to impaired coordination.\n\nDrunken Dodge:\nFrequency: Passive ability.\nMechanics: The Boozemancer has trained their body to react unpredictably, granting them advantage on Dexterity saving throws against area effects. In addition, any time an area effect misses them due to Drunken Dodge, they may move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, as if they've literally stumbled out of danger.\n\nBrew Blast:\nFrequency: Can be used as an action, twice per short rest.\nMechanics: Unleashes a cone of alcoholic vapor that ignites upon contact with air, dealing 2d6 fire damage to all in its path and possibly intoxicating them.\n\nSpirit Fog:\nFrequency: Once per long rest, as an action.\nMechanics: Casts a dense fog smelling of strong spirits in a 20-foot radius. Obscures vision and can disorient enemies, causing disadvantage on their attack rolls and ability checks.]\n\nCantrips:[\nHangover Haze:\nEffects: Clouds an area with a mind-numbing fog, causing confusion and disorientation.\nMechanics: Targets in a 10-foot radius must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on their next attack or skill check.\n\nSloshed Step:\nEffects: Enhances the caster's movement, mimicking the stumbling of a drunkard.\nMechanics: Teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space that the caster can see.\n]\n\nSpell slots:\nFour 1st-level spell slots\nThree 2nd-level spell slots\nTwo 3rd-level spell slots\nOne 4th-level spell slot\n\nSpellcasting:\n1st Level Spells:[\nIntoxicating Aegis: For the next minute, a shimmering shield of alcoholic vapor envelopes the Boozemancer, granting a +5 bonus to AC. This vaporous guard has a slight chance to cause enemies that strike the Boozemancer at close range to become poisoned.\n\nBooze Bolt: Cast as an action, flings a bolt of condensed spirits in a straight line up to 30 feet. On hit, deals 1d10 force damage and has a chance to confuse the target, potentially causing them to attack a random creature within range on their next turn.]\n\n2nd Level Spells:[\nFrosty Libation: Cast as an action, conjures a 15-foot-radius sphere of freezing alcohol vapor centered on a point within range. Creatures within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 3d6 cold damage and have their speed halved until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, they take half damage and aren't slowed.\n\nDrunken Resilience: As a bonus action, the Boozemancer drinks deeply from their Everflowing Mug, regaining hit points equal to 2d8 + their Constitution modifier. However, each use increases their inebriation, imposing a cumulative -1 penalty on Wisdom saving throws and skill checks until they take a short or long rest to sober up.\nFrequency: Usable twice per long rest.]\n\n3rd Level Spells:[\nLiquid Courage: The Boozemancer downs an enchanted brew that invigorates their spirits and fortifies their flesh. They immediately regain hit points equal to 4d6 + Constitution modifier. Additionally, for the next 10 minutes, they gain resistance to fear and charm effects. But beware, each use leaves them more sloshed, adding a stacking penalty to Intelligence and Wisdom checks until the buzz wears off.\nFrequency: Twice per long rest.\n\nBarrel Roll: The Boozemancer summons an illusory barrel that rolls in a straight line for up to 30 feet. Each creature in its path must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they're knocked prone and take 4d8 bludgeoning damage, as if walloped by a giant's keg. On a successful save, they manage to dodge aside, taking only half damage.\nFrequency: Once per short rest.]\n\n4th Level Spells:[\nGrand Hangover: With a grand gesture, the Boozemancer summons a swirling vortex of alcohol-laden air. The spell affects all living enemies in a 20-foot radius centered on a point the Boozemancer can see within range. Victims caught in the maelstrom must make a Constitution saving throw or become sickened by a supernatural hangover. Affected enemies suffer a disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and their movement is halved as nausea takes hold. If they fail save throws, they are incapacitated due to intense vomitting. The effect lasts for 1d4 rounds.\nFrequency: Once per long rest.]\n\n</character_sheet_boozemancer_wizard>",

It is a weapon of choice for archers who command the power of the storm.\nAttack Stats: Ranged: +10 to attack rolls, 2d8 piercing damage\nSpecial Abilities: On a hit, deals an additional 2d6 lightning damage. Additionally, once per day, the wielder can cast the lightning arrow spell without expending a spell slot.]\n\nSoulfire:[\n\nDescription: Crafted from the bones of a fire giant and infused with the essence of the Elemental Plane of Fire, this composite bow burns with intense flames. It is a devastating weapon favored by those who seek to immolate their enemies.\nAttack Stats: Ranged: +9 to attack rolls, 2d10 piercing damage\nSpecial Abilities: On a hit, deals an additional 2d8 fire damage. Additionally, once per day, the wielder can cast the fireball spell at 5th level without expending a spell slot.]\n\nStarfall:[\nDescription: Crafted from a rare metal found only in the depths of the Astral Sea, this crossbow gleams with the light of distant stars. It is a weapon of unparalleled accuracy and power, capable of striking down foes from great distances.\nAttack Stats: Ranged: +12 to attack rolls, 2d12 piercing damage\nSpecial Abilities: On a hit, deals an additional 3d6 force damage. Additionally, once per day, the wielder can cast the magic missile spell at 5th level without expending a spell slot.]\n\nZephyr's Final Breath:\n[A longbow so lithe and light that it seems to be made from the very essence of the wind. Its string sings a sorrowful dirge with every release, a lament for those it sends to their final rest.\nAttack Stats: Ranged: +5 to attack rolls, 3d8 piercing damage\nSpecial Abilities: Every arrow loosed from this bow carries with it the mournful force of a gale strong enough to knock foes off their feet. Once per long rest, the wielder can activate 'Breath of the Zephyr,' causing a single arrow to multiply into a thousand, blanketing the sky and raining devastation across the battlefield.]\n\nHell's Whisperer:\n[A crossbow forged from black iron drawn from the River Styx and strung with chains that resonate with the silent screams of the damned.\nAttack Stats: Ranged: +6 to attack rolls, 3d10 piercing damage\nSpecial Abilities: Bolts fired from this crossbow are laced with the essence of torment, each hit causing enemies to relive their worst nightmares. Once per long rest, the wielder may invoke 'Whisper of Hell,' a bolt infused with infernal energy that seeks out its target, ignoring cover and armor to strike true and paralyze with fear.]\n\nVoidtouched Spike]:\n[A javelin carved from the remnants of a star that died in utter isolation, emanating an aura of desolation that chills the soul.\nAttack Stats: Ranged: +6 to attack rolls, 4d6 piercing damage; Melee: +5 to attack rolls, 2d10 piercing damage\nSpecial Abilities: Imbued with a void essence that devours light and hope, any wound inflicted by this javelin festers as it tears at the fabric of reality. Thrice per long rest, the wielder can unleash 'Impalement of the Void,' instantly transporting any non-magical target impaled by the javelin into a pocket dimension of darkness for one minute\u2014unless they succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw.]\n\nBuriza-Do Kyanon:\n[Description: Forged in the frigid depths of the Frost Giant's keep, this crossbow is encased in ice that never melts. Its limbs are carved from the bones of a frost drake, and the string is made from the sinew of a yeti's heart.\nAttack Stats: Ranged: +6 to attack rolls, 2d10 piercing damage\nSpecial Abilities: On a hit, the Buriza-Do Kyanon releases a burst of arctic cold, dealing an additional 2d8 cold damage and potentially slowing the target by half for one round. Twice per long rest, the wielder can activate 'Glacial Storm,' an area-of-effect attack that summons a swirling blizzard in a 30-foot radius. Enemies caught in the storm take 6d8 cold damage and must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be frozen solid, immobilized for one minute or until they take fire damage.]\n\nWindforce:\n[This longbow is masterfully sculpted from the heart of an ancient treant that perished in a legendary tempest. Its limbs are supple yet unbreakable, thrumming with the unleashed fury of a thousand gales.\nAttack Stats: Ranged: +7 to attack rolls, 3d8 piercing damage\nSpecial Abilities: Imbues each arrow with the wrath of the storm, granting them a piercing howl as they fly. Windforce has a 'Rapid Gale Strike,' allowing the wielder to launch a volley of three arrows simultaneously in rapid succession thrice per long rest. Each arrow carries the force of a tempest, capable of knocking enemies off their feet. Once per encounter, the archer can invoke 'Heartseeker's Gale,' releasing a magic arrow that seeks the heart of a foe, guided by the wind. This arrow never misses, automatically scoring a critical hit and dealing double damage.]",
