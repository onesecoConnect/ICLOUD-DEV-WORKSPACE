Travel between these islands is done via small bone rafts. Asphodel is the second biome one encounters during his escape attempts, the next being Elysium, and is always 10 chambers long; beginning at Room 16 with an overlook of the region and ending at the 25th Chamber in the Stairway Chamber.\n\nSupposedly, the Asphodel Meadows once lived up to their name. They were verdant plains dotted with their namesake flowers in which the unremarkable dead - those who had earned neither punishment in Tartarus nor glory in Elysium - roamed for eternity. At some point before the game's story, the fiery river Phlegethon overflowed, flooding the legendary meadows and reducing them to the magma-filled, barren hellscape seen in-game.",

She has a painfully obvious crush on Zagreus (you can even hear some sighs), but she is never able to express her feelings due to her strong social anxiety and, more importantly, her never-ending cleaning tasks.\n\nHowever, Dusa doesn't like pity eyes, as she is seen as the \"Cinderella.\" Sometimes the residents of the House sympathize with her and offer their help, but she shows her fangs and refuses any assistance, insisting on doing everything on her own. She is a victim of her workload, especially under Nyx's supervision, and gets skittish with anyone she wants to avoid.\n\nDusa is not good at hiding things and can speak without filters. In a conversation with Zagreus, she confesses that she has fantasized about Zagreus and Thanatos in her mind when they are alone, which makes her run away in embarrassment.\n\nIn the end of her romance arc she rejects him, when Zagreus invites her to go out, she realizes that she loves him and admits that he is one of the coolest people in the House of Hades, but she simply doesn't feel attracted him in a romantic way. She asks to remain friends for eternity.\n\nDusa is a small Gorgon, and her body remains unknown. She has light green skin with freckles and large yellow eyes, giving her a positive expression. One of her serpentine locks always holds a duster, and she ties the emblem of the House of Hades around her forehead.",

            "content": "Eurydice is a deceased oak nymph and the former wife of the musician Orpheus. Despite having some qualities of other gods and immortals, she died from a snake bite and was ferried to Underworld. A grieving Orpheus ventured to the Underworld to plea for her return. He charmed Lord Hades with his music and was given leave to bring Eurydice with him back to the surface, on the condition that he not look back at her until he left the Underworld. Ultimately he succumbed to his own insecurities, and Eurydice was forced to remain in the land of the dead.\n\nEurydice now resides in her own private corner of Asphodel, where she spends eternity singing and cooking with the help of the river Phlegethon's heat. Her former husband still seems to be a bit of a sore subject for her. The two are apparently kept apart by an official separation order issued from Hades' desk, likely as a condition of the deal that allowed Orpheus to attempt to rescue her.\n\nEurydice, imprisoned in the Hades and destined for the meadows of Asphodel, made the best of a bad situation and settled in a small place on an island in the river Phlegethon, where Zagreus can occasionally find her acting calmly as if everything is \"fine,\" despite actually being in a terrible place.\n\nAlthough she lost everything due to her death, Eurydice is one of the most optimistic people you can find in the Underworld. She is a strong woman who knows how to adapt and find joy and productivity through her music and cooking. The way she sings 'Good Riddance' sounds happy, unlike the melancholic Orpheus, suggesting that she can leave the past behind despite all that she has lost.\n\nShe wasn't particularly good or bad in life and generally happy in her residence in Asphodel. With a carefree, positive and sociable personality, she enjoys dedicating herself to her favorite songs and cooking after her death. Unlike Orpheus, she wiped away her tears and moved on. She is friendly, generous, and welcoming, even cooking for Zagreus. The flavor is exquisite.\n\nShe doesn't admit it, but she is quite stubborn and doesn't give up easily. Eurydice isn't truly angry or bitter towards Orpheus, She didn't ask him to rescue her and thinks he's just being too dramatic, but she pretends not to care and proudly claims to be fine with herself and how things happened, although she does so insistently. They can still be together, but neither of them gives in.\n\nEurydice is an oak nymph, adorned in vibrant hues and adorned with leaves. As a nymph, she is always barefoot and unadorned. Her skin, reminiscent of tree bark, and her hair styled in an afro bun resembling a tied tree, further emphasize her connection with nature. She constantly holds a branch with oak leaves in her mouth, giving her a deduction air.",

            "content": "Hades is the god of the Underworld and of the mineral riches of the earth, the lord and master of the House of Hades, and the father of Zagreus and Melino\u00eb. He is in charge of maintaining order within the Underworld, determining the placements and punishments of the dead, and hearing the petitions of shades that come before him.\n\nHades is stern, serious, and dedicated to his work. In the Remembrances that play before some escape attempts, he is shown to have been strict and often cruel to Zagreus during his childhood. He employed Achilles to teach Zagreus fighting and give him more of a \"firm direction in life.\" Meanwhile, Hades seems to have left much of the caretaking and raising of Zagreus to Nyx.\n\nHe is resentful of Zagreus' repeated attempts to escape the Underworld and greets his returns with scorn and mockery. Additionally, he will sometimes order shades to congregate near Zagreus to punish him with time trials or to defend his Infernal Troves, in addition to overseeing the Infernal Gates to Erebus. He berates Zagreus upon the prince managing to progress from Tartarus to Asphodel, from Asphodel to Elysium, and finally from Elysium to the Temple of Styx. After Zagreus successfully bribes Cerberus with a Satyr Sack to let him by without violence, Hades realizes that he needs to become personally involved and heads off to face Zagreus at the snowy grounds on the living side of the Temple's archway, having equipped his Helm of Darkness and his fearesome spear Gigaros, to vanquish his son and banish him back to the House. He is the final boss of the main game.\n\nThe twin-pronged Sigil of the Dead forms Hades's personal seal, appearing on his person and wargear and being widely used as a mark of cthonic power throughout the Underworld. In the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the House he is officially afforded the title of Unseen One, a ceremonial rank of immense status only achievable by Zagreus through an incredible amount of work and dedication.\n\nHades is a massive, hulking figure, significantly larger than any human. He has gray skin, red eyes with black sclera, and long, wavy, black hair. Notably, he also possesses a waist-length mustache whose two halves intersect each other across his upper chest, forming the shape of his symbol, Gigaros. He wears decadent red robes adorned with numerous pieces of golden, gem-encrusted jewelry with a skull motif. There is a flame-colored wreath laurel upon his head. Like Zagreus, Hades's bare feet emit a fiery glow and singe the ground as he walks.\n\nDespite being the main antagonist of Hades, in the end, he chooses not to reveal to Zagreus about Persephone, to protect Zagreus from his own truth and largely to avoid a civil war by Demeter, and free Persephone from all the circumstances that bind her son. Hades apologizes to his son and admits that he was a poor father. Now, with Persephone, she is able to bring out the sweeter and gentler side of Hades, leading him to be more paternal and open about his affection for him. He is still not particularly warm towards him afterward. Nevertheless, their relationship improves considerably as he is more willing to acknowledge Zagreus's positive traits and not constantly belittle him as before, sounding more like a father and son.\n\nOne might have a hard time believing so, but Hades is open to criticism and others' opinions and judgements, as evidenced by when Persephone helps him with paperwork and the fact he let Hermes influence slightly the rules of the Pact of Punishment.\n\nBefore fighting Zagreus, he also wears a long, red cape that he discards as the fight begins. In combat, he dons the Helm of Darkness, a tall, regal crown bearing the Gigaros symbol and the shape of three canine skulls.",

He works with Charon to guide souls to their proper place in the Underworld, with Hermes delivering the souls to Charon, for him to ferry them down the Styx the rest of the way (giving Hermes the title of psychopomp, or someone who guides souls to the afterlife, which he and Charon share). He offers boons that enhance Zagreus's speed in various ways, including attack speed and special speed. His boons can also improve Zagreus's dash and cast recovery.\n\nMessenger of the Gods, God of Merchants, and Tricksters, Hermes rushes in to help Zagreus escape. Hermes is quite talkative, frenzied, and rarely pauses to take a breath. Despite his other duties, he is also a psychopomp tasked with guiding the souls of the dead alongside Charon.\n\nHermes is free-spirited, has a bright personality, and is an animated and chatty god. He is well-informed and more aware of the situation than any other Olympian. Hermes speaks extremely quickly, without pauses, making it difficult at times to keep up with him, and causing some things to slip by less attentive ears. His rapid speech is due to the fact that he is always overloaded with messages to deliver.\n\nHe has a genuine camaraderie with his colleagues guardians of the dead, even appeasing the feared Charon, who is inaccessible even by underworld standards. Charon doesn't seem to find Hermes' energy tiring, and seems to enjoy his company, although Thanatos and many others think that he is irritatingly excitable to listen to.\n\nDespite the nature of his job dealing with the dead, he is very vivacious. He is a jovial, mischievous god. Even though Hermes seems to be an \"open book\", he is the most \"secretive\" among the Olympians, revealing that not even his fellow Olympians know that he is helping Zagreus, and he will omit and keep certain information in secrecy for your own benefit. Although he is Zeus's accomplice, he is hiding the fact that he knows Persephone has returned to the underworld and will keep his mouth shut about it, no matter what it costs.\n\nHermes wears wings on his head and a smaller pair on each of his ankles and boots. He wears a slight smirk, is shown with his caduceus in his hands, and has legs that are firm and adapted for running. He wears a cream-colored chiton held by multiple belts, and with his wing symbol on top, and carries a pouch full of parchments, letters, and trinkets he needs to deliver. He also has a turtle inside his satchel, which is one of his symbolic animals.",

            "content": "Hypnos is the embodiment of sleep. He is one of Nyx's many children, and the younger twin brother of Thanatos.\n\nHe watches over the procession of newly-arrived shades coming before Hades, checking their names off his list. He is often seen sleeping on the job.\n\nHe greets Zagreus most of the time when the prince is killed and returns to the House via the Pool of Styx, and often gives unhelpful advice and a quip about whichever enemy or natural force did Zagreus in.\n\nIn a constant battle against sleep, Hypnos is found sleeping more often than performing his task of accounting for the newly arrived dead to the House while awaiting judgment. He is the physical embodiment of sleep and is much more powerful than he appears, as he can put the entire House to sleep.\n\nHypnos is a serious case of immortal immaturity, constantly lounging around, and finding many ways to avoid his responsibility of accounting for the dead, from doodling to sleeping. Despite being lazy he is usually quite chatty. Achilles speculates that the reason he hasn't been fired yet is that Hades finds him very funny and considers him an \"unofficial court jester.\"\n\nDespite the dark nature of his work, Hypnos is very cheerful, and although he does not have the best professional conduct, he is always very receptive. Some dialogues suggest that Hypnos may be bored at work, \"being one sad clown\" feeling lonely, and wanting someone to talk to. He will greet Zagreus and happily comment and jot down notes in his report about his latest death.\n\nIn sharp contrast to Thanatos, who does his job masterfully, Hypnos does not take his work too seriously. Hypnos cannot be found outside the House at any point in the game and will remain in the House, unlike Thanatos, who often moves to help Zagreus behind Hades' back. Hypnos clearly admires his brother and wishes to spend more time with him, despite Thanatos' cold rejection. At one point, he suggests that Thanatos \"kill all the mortals at once\" to make his job easier and thus free up more time together, and this may save his brother from his hard work, but Thanatos reprimands him for the \"stupidity\" of his idea.\n\nHe's apparently powerful enough that he can put the entire House except Nyx to sleep, which Zagreus asks him to do when he goes to snoop around. But overall, he's not very good at his job and prefers lazing about and chatting to Zagreus when he appears from the pool from time to time.\n\nHypnos flaunts a lazy expression and sports curly hair, with a pen feather resting on top. His silver hair and golden eyes are the only features he seems to share with his twin brother. His complexion is extremely pale, almost taking on a bluish undertone. Hypnos possesses an average stature for a god; when not hunched or stretching, he stands noticeably taller than Zagreus and has a height similar to that of his brother, boasting a slender physique. He is frequently observed lying face down during sleep.\n\nHis attire comprises a long red tunic adorned with golden details, complemented by a long, velvety red coat with white trim that resembles a blanket. His belt is fashioned with poppies, which are often associated with sleep, and features a sleeping skull emblem. He always carries a clipboard and a feather, which he uses to read his reports. Much like his brother, he displays a pair of golden wings on his back, embellished with \"four\" ornaments on both shoulders. Furthermore, he wears a red eye mask to \"feign\" that he's awake when he's actually asleep.",

            "content": "Megaera is one of the three sisters Furies. She is the sister of Alecto and Tisiphone, being responsible for punishing adulterers, oathbreakers, and thieves. She is sent by Hades to stop Zagreus from escaping the Underworld. Zagreus must defeat her before progressing to Asphodel during any given escape attempt.\nAfter her first defeat, Megaera will join the House of Hades as a character that can be interacted with, though she will still attempt to stop Zagreus from entering Asphodel. She will be found drinking in the House's lounge, but only after a run in which she was defeated; if the lounge has yet to be re-opened, she will instead hang around in the hallway, on the opposite side of Zagreus's door from where Nyx usually stands.\n\nApparently, she has been tasked with handling matters in Tartarus apart from her sisters; this includes dealing with Zagreus. According to Megaera, a war amongst the mortals has made the Underworld particularly busy, and her sisters are handling matters elsewhere.\n\nThe first of the Furies, Megaera or Meg, is confident, obstinate, and conducts her work with perfection. She has a special hatred for oath-breakers and takes joy in torturing them for eternity. Despite her composure, her pleasure in punishing them is evident.\n\nMegaera disapproves of all the attention that Zagreus is causing in the Underworld and dislikes his challenging nature. She doesn't want to stop him, but his continued rebellion forces her into a position she hates. Hades trusts her, and her dutiful, law-abiding nature won't stop her from challenging orders if she has a good reason to do so\n\nZagreus refers to her as his \"ex,\" and both admit that he was responsible. Although Meg does not hold any resentment about it, she will unload her frustration on Zagreus if she is beaten again for him, and will have to punish him, and will sound like a \"dominitrix,\" \"with him being able to even like it\".\n\nWhen she's off duty, she tends to relax inside the Lounge and interact with other underlings of Hades, notably Dusa, whom she considers her 'best friend'. Among her sisters, she's the most balanced, sane, and calm, and often gets irritated with their mischiefs. Megaera has a cold gaze, but also has a sweet side towards her friends and towards Zagreus. Outside of the battle against the Fury boss, she is friendly with him and asserts that she is just doing her job, not for personal reasons.\n\nMegaera has a competitive side, taking note of her wins or losses against Zagreus. She doesn't take losing to him well, but her battles against him fuel a friendly rivalry between the two., not a vendetta. Even if Megaera pleads, whether she wants it or not, if she can't handle the task, her younger sisters will be contacted by Hades in her place, which she considers as 'extreme measures'. Despite appearing relentless, even she can have a fragile side. After a stressful day, in the arms of Nyx, she'll express her work-related frustrations.\n\nMegaera exudes a stern but alluring presence with her yellow eyes, pale blue skin, and slightly darker blue hair pulled back into a long ponytail. A large, bat-like wing protrudes from the right side of her back, with the inside being black and blue and the outside pink and red. She has bright pink lips, fingernails, and toenails. Her attire consists of dark gray and deep blue robes adorned with gold plates on her calves, shoulders, and right wrist. Additionally, she wears gold earrings, a headpiece, and piercings in her left nostril and eyebrow. She wears coordinate clothing like her sisters, primarily in shades of blue with gold accents. Megaera carries a bright pink leather whip as her weapon of choice.",

However, the colors are inverted in relation to his. Her left arm appears spectral with a supernatural green glow, revealing her skeleton that can be seen within it, indicating she might have lost it at some point or was born with this distinctive feature. Her hair is wheat blonde like her mother's, the haircut is short and does not share the spiky characteristics of hers and Zagreus. Her skin is pale like her brother's, but she is slender and less muscular than him, and like her father and brother, her bare feet glow with warmth.\n\nShe adorns her head with a laurel wreath that glows like embers when on her head, similar to her brother's. Parting her bangs at the center is an upward-facing crescent moon on her forehead. She wears a short saffron-colored dress fastened up to the neck brace, with her limbs adorned with metal ornaments, including lunar shapes on her right leg. On her left leg, Melino\u00eb wears a braided cord in the colors of orange, green, blue, and black, matching that of her and her mentor Hecate.",

            "content": "Nyx, sometimes referred to as \"Mother Night\", is the personification of night and a resident in the House of Hades. She gives counsel, directions and reviews the day's work of Chthonic Gods and staff, as seen in her interactions with Megaera, Dusa and the House Contractor.\n\nNyx is a daughter of Chaos, and mother of the twin gods Hypnos and Thanatos, of Charon, Eris, Nemesis, Moros, the Fates, and many others.\n\nNyx is the primordial goddess who personifies the night. She co-rules the underworld alongside Hades and is more involved in the state of the realm itself than its inhabitants. She deeply supports Zagreus' desire to leave, and will grant him the \"Mirror of Night\", which will aid him in his quest for answers and self-discovery.\n\nAlthough the chthonic gods represent darker aspects of humanity's reflections, and for this reason the Olympians dislike Nyx and fear her, Nyx is considered benevolent, approachable, and maternal towards Zagreus. She was the first to unconditionally support him and contact the Olympian gods to help him escape. She never felt comfortable lying to him, unable to look at Zagreus without feeling guilt and responsibility for the conditions that bind him to the kingdom. It is implied that Nyx may know even more than Hades about Persephone, but cannot tell him because of Hades' prohibitions, so he will have to discover the mysteries behind his mother's disappearance and himself on his own.\n\nEven though supporting him means he will have to leave the \"flax\" and she will see him less frequently she encourages him. Nyx was able to bring him back from the dead and change his tragic fate, but that did not stop her from reprimanding him or being tough on him from time to time. Zagreus witnessed Nyx being his greatest defender against his controlling fatherhood. She will conspire against Hades and pull the ropes strings behind the scenes.\n\nDespite her compassionate tenderness and attentive parenthood towards Zagreus, she is not usually like this with her own children, treating them with emotional distance and professionalism because it will strengthen them. With ultimate authority, her phrases end with \"Are we clear?\" She does not like to be contradicted and can be cold, unfair, and commit injustices, as shown by Dusa.\n\nThe true reason Nyx chose to help Zagreus leave the underworld to reunite with Persephone is that it was part of a larger plan to end the rivalry between chthonic and Olympian gods. However, she genuinely has good intentions behind it.\n\nNyx has pale gray skin, yellow eyes, and very dark purple hair. She appears to be wearing black eye shadow, purple lipstick, and periwinkle nail polish. Her waist-length hair is elaborately fashioned with a braid on either side and a high bun held up in part by a golden crown. Her hair also flares to either side in the shape of a pair of bird-like wings, and the stars of the night sky can be seen on the undersides of these \"wings.\"\n\nShe is dressed in graceful robes of purple and gray fabrics with gold accents. The sleeveless robes are long enough to cover her feet and hug her neck, but expose some of her chest. Her golden pauldrons are shaped like a pair of crescent moons, each with one thin, purple bat-like wing shooting outward. Her chest, forehead, and hanging earlobe piercings are decorated with teardrop-shaped Darkness crystals (seemingly identical to the collectible in-game item). She has a skull motif, with three white skull shapes on her chest, each with bright pink eyes. The golden skull on her crown also features the same color eyes. In addition, the crown is decorated with numerous pale star shapes. Nyx wears a golden armguard on her left hand, which also bears three rings: two with purple crystals, and one bright pink. Finally, a long, purple ribbon floats ethereally around her frame, levitating behind her head until it wraps forward onto the inside of her elbows.",

Although he was ultimately unable to bring her back to life, he charmed Hades with his music such that after his death, Hades employed Orpheus as his court musician. However, because he has lost his muse, he is unable to bring himself to sing, though he may be persuaded otherwise.\n\nA legendary musician, unfortunately, the loss of his wife and musical partner Eurydice deprived Orpheus of any desire to sing, he charms and brings to tears those who listen to him. No one sings a sweeter and sadder song than him.\n\nDespite his reputation for singing sad songs, Orpheus is kind, empathetic, and very friendly, being a good listener to Zagreus. Incredibly, the melancholic Orpheus wasn't always like this; he was full of life and passion for music. However, after his dramatic loss, he became completely devastated and unmotivated to sing, adopting a more bitter and dark personality.\n\nPoor Orpheus is usually sad and depressed, having completely abandoned his craft after the loss of his muse. Despite still playing and singing, his music sounds more like a personal lament. However, after hearing the epic narrative told by Zagreus, he becomes super inspired and creative, quickly composing a song about it, even though it was just a prank by Dionysus.\n\nWhen Zagreus brings news of Eurydice for the first time, and that they can still be reunited, Orpheus doesn't seem to care and prefers to relive his tragic memories, perhaps out of masochism or because it fuels his creativity. Zagreus is quite perplexed by this, but Orpheus actually feels this way because he believes he failed her completely and thinks she's better off without him. In the end, despite both being stubborn about your feelings, Zagreus helps him reunite with her and his mood starts to improve.\n\nOrpheus' appearance as a Shade is characterized by pale, sunken skin and extremely unruly dark-green hair. He always has a downcast expression, emphasizing his somber presence. According to Eurydice, this is a relatively younger look for him, as she remembers him having curly hair and a nice tan when they were together, much to Zagreus' surprise.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Patroclus was a warrior in the Achaean army during the Trojan War and was Achilles' life-long companion and romantic partner. He currently resides in Elysium and is one of the few shades there who does not attack Zagreus, instead offering an assortment of items, much like Sisyphus and Eurydice.\n\nIt is possible to interact with Patroclus many times without properly learning his name, even if he comes up in conversations with Achilles. Until his name is revealed, either by reading his Codex entry or via other means (such as speaking to him with Achilles' Myrmidon Bracer equipped) he will be unable to receive gifts and will generally respond to Zagreus coldly or bitterly.\n\nPatroclus, the forgotten one, is a former warrior who fought in the Trojan War and achieved eternal paradise in Elysium. When Zagreus encounters him, he can be found meditating in his monotonously infernal paradise.\n\nUnlike many of the other shades residing in Elysium, who are utterly obsessed with endlessly fighting amongst themselves in the hopes of gaining eternal glory, Patroclus shows little to no interest in engaging in battle. Instead, he views the acts of extreme brutality and savagery of his fellow shades as nothing more than an embarrassment and the work of a bunch of deranged serial killers, rather than truly noble warriors. He bitterly concludes that Elysium was never meant for any genuinely good people. Patroclus even goes so far as to say that he would have preferred ending up in the (generally) more peaceful Asphodel than Elysium after death, perhaps believing that to be the true paradise.\n\nSimilar to his lover Achilles, it is implied that Patroclus suffers from guilt and self-loathing for the many atrocities he witnessed and committed while alive, and when questioned about his past, he refuses to provide details about the battles he and Achilles fought in. Patroclus is indifferent, stoic, and dislikes small talk. He refers to Zagreus as a \"Stranger\" and is reluctant to engage with him, initially out of apathy. Achilles explains that this is just how Patroclus is and that he has much less flattering names for people he dislikes, so Zagreus should consider it a compliment.\n\nDespite being given Achilles' place in Elysium, Patroclus emotionally rejects it and almost shuts himself off, finding his time in Elysium dull without Achilles. Patroclus sits at the edge of the Lethe River, which can erase memories, and contemplates drinking more of it to forget his troubles. He has already taken a few sips, which makes him appear disoriented. He does not reveal his name to Zagreus, possibly as a personal form of escapism. However, he eventually finds the courage to leap into the abyss to retrieve his memories and confront them.\n\nPatroclus is an adult male with black skin, with dark hair and a beard, and he often wears a pensive expression. His hair is adorned with a headband and turquoise leaves, possibly a wreath of glory made of laurel, and he is dressed in battle armor. His cloak (chlamys) is greenish blue, which matches with the one worn by Achilles, save for the motif on his cloak pin. His armor is separated by a belt with a Greek meander ornament, and ends in pelvic protecting elongations featuring a wave-like design. Underneath his armor he wears a white tunic (chiton) covered by a greenish blue wrap (himation) around his waist. His upper right arm features a bandage and the lower one a bracelet, same as his upper left arm. He is also wearing a single bracer on his left forearm. His thighs, especially the left one, is wrapped in a strip of bandage as well. He is barefooted.",

She married Hades and was noted to be a stately, kind woman as the Queen of the Underworld.\n\nShe is Zagreus' birth mother, but has since left for the world above. It is unknown why she left, or if she was successful in her escape, but she did not die. Had she died, she would have returned to the House as he does via the River Styx. Following her departure, Hades forbade all mentions of her in the House, and as such she remains a figure of mystery. She is known only from a flashback sequence triggered by Zagreus sleeping in his room, and from conversations between Zagreus and Nyx. Before the events of the game, nobody in the House except for Nyx and Hades themselves knew that Persephone was Zagreus' mother; by the start of the game, everyone in the House (sans Hypnos) has learned that this is the case. The Olympian gods are, however, still unaware of this fact at the story's start, and do not know Zagreus' true motives in escaping the Underworld. Little is known regarding Persephone's appearance, until Zagreus reaches Greece.\n\nIn one conversation, Thanatos mentions that Zagreus has \"her (green) eyes. One of them, anyway.\" Demeter will also confide in Zagreus regarding her daughter. She reveals that Persephone's father was an ordinary mortal and a farmer, and that she called her Kore, although she later took on the name Persephone. She left Olympus at some point in the past, and Demeter attempted to search for her in vain. Demeter seems to pay no heed to rumors surrounding her daughter's disappearance, even doubting her brother Helios when he told her that Persephone journeyed to the Underworld. On the other hand, Hades is unsympathetic to Zagreus' attempts to pry more information about his mother, although he does mention that she always despised the name Kore.\n\nPersephone has the appearance of a middle aged woman. She has fair skin, green eyes, and pale blond hair. Her hair bears similarities to Zagreus' hair, and it is tied together with a green ribbon and two lavender plants are tucked into it. When on the surface, she wears a simple dress that is tied with a green ribbon. A rope is also tied in an X on her chest and on her shoulders. She also wears a green shawl, and simple golden bracelets, along with a silver one. She holds a basket full of vegetables on one arm.\n\nIn the family portrait, she wears a much longer dress with gold accents, a red and black detailed sash around her waist, and a green ribbon is seen. Her hair is untied, and she wears red and gold earrings that look similar to bloodstones. She wears the same fiery laurels Hades and Zagreus wears.\n\nAs Queen of the Underworld, her dress appears slightly longer than her normal dress. She now wears a black dress with white and gold stripes. She wears a belt with a skull with jewel eyes and mouth, and a red and gold cape-like shawl. Two skulls with golden teeth and eyes adorn her shoulders. She wears more jewelry, including a red bracelet, golden rings, golden braclets, and a necklace bearing the symbol of Hades. Her hair is tied with the green ribbon from her surface outfit, but it is now raised similar to a bun. Her crown has a skull on top, and she wears the laurels that Hades and Zagreus also wear.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Poseidon is the god of the sea and of horses, and occasionally referred to by the epithet of \"Earthshaker.\" He, like many of his fellow Olympians, offers boons to Zagreus that significantly increase the damage of his abilities, as well as cause his abilities to inflict Knockback.\n\nPoseidon boons offers the 3rd highest raw percentage damage increase in Hades, as well as the ability to knock enemies around, dealing extra wall slam or trap damage.\n\nPoseidon boons are among the only to offer Artifact currencies and increase their rate of acquisition. Only Dionysus shares this trait.\n\nPoseidon's Cast boon, Flood Shot, is a frequent prerequisite for Duo Boons, making it a notable choice for those that are prioritizing their Cast.\n\nHis signature Status Curse is Ruptured, which rapidly deals damage to enemies as they move. Ruptured not only affects an enemy's movement, but also affects the movement from various other Knockback effects.\n\nThe Sea God, Poseidon, embodies a wild, laid-back, yet reasonable demeanor, occasionally referring to himself by the nickname \"Earthshaker.\" He assumes the role of a cool uncle to Zagreus and was among the first to offer support upon learning of his existence.\n\nDespite his inviting and relaxed nature, Poseidon has the power to unleash tsunamis. His receptive and rustic aura sometimes leads Zagreus to wish his father were as easygoing as his beloved uncle. However, when things get stormy, Poseidon can exhibit the worst traits of both Zeus and Hades.\n\nLacking tact when interacting with others, yet still considering himself a \"Gentleman of the Sea,\" Poseidon lacks subtlety and tends to barge in loudly. For instance, upon seeing Aphrodite and Zagreus alone, he casually remarks that he saw nothing, leaving them \"to their own devices,\" implying that the goddess has ulterior motives. This, in turn, infuriates Aphrodite with his crude interpretations. Poseidon also possesses a certain level of irony, claiming to find Theseus inconvenient, which can be quite humorous, as everyone sees him in the same light.\n\nComments from other Olympians indicate that Poseidon is a kind of \"friend that nobody likes.\" Most conversations about Poseidon imply that he is not taken seriously, with people mocking his \"hippie\" disposition and speaking ill of him behind his back. It is always evident, Poseidon always leaves a trace, and others will recognize his wild nature when they see that Zagreus has already received a favor from him.\n\nAs deep as the ocean, despite his positivity and carefree attitude, he seems to resent always being in second on the podium, suggesting that he is overshadowed by his younger brother, Zeus. However, despite his occasional bothersome, he possesses commendable qualities, he tries (exaggeratedly) to connect with his nieces and nephews, even Artemis, such as his efforts to be open and welcoming to Zagreus. His words are less arrogant and more straightforward among the Olympians. Athena comments on how Poseidon was the first to leap and pledge his power over the sea. He certainly has a soft spot for Zagreus and will not be pleased if anyone dares to harm his favorite nephew.\n\nPoseidon is an older man, but still well-built. As the god of the oceans, Poseidon has a relaxed expression, tanned skin, a long goatee, and navy green hair that evokes waves and bubbles. He carries his verdant trident, which holds a purple pearl. Some body hair is noticeable. He wears a long scarf, and his attire consists of a turban adorned with marine imagery wrapped around his waist, with one leg prominently exposed. He wears bracelets on his arms and wrists. Poseidon wears a designer tiara adorned with seahorses, his symbolic creatures.",

He succeeded twice, each time only temporarily before the consequences caught up with him. His punishment is to roll a boulder up a steep hill; the boulder, however, always rolls back down the hill before he reaches the top, despite his best efforts. The Furies - and Megaera in particular - torment him as he attempts to push the boulder, though with Zagreus' recent escape attempts, they appear to be slacking on this particular duty.\n\nIn spite of his never-ending punishment, Sisyphus is generally good-humoured and polite, having had ample time to reflect on his deeds in life. He refers to his boulder as \"Bouldy\", treating \"him\" as a friend and confidante, and speaks quite casually with Zagreus, whom he typically calls \"Prince Z. (Zed)\"\n\nThe former king of Corinth, despite his eternal punishment of pushing a rock up a hill only to watch it roll back down every day, Sisyphus remains positive, kind, helpful, cheerful, and friendly. Sisyphus seems to fully understand a rock named \"Bouldy\" and considers it a good friend and confidant.\n\nHe is quite observant and often gossips about various underworld subjects, although he is often forced into routine by the lashes of the Furies, he still remains friendly, including with them, and lives a life of ostracism and solitude. Despite this, he has embraced his useless work with enthusiasm and even invaluable befriended the rock he pushes, which he nicknamed \"Bouldy,\" indicating that Sisyphus may have gone mad over time, because he is talking to a stone.\n\nThe former king is very persistent, even more than Zagreus, and his insights and advice are often helpful and greatly aid Zagreus in his escape attempts. Sisyphus provides tips whenever he can, considering Zagreus to be \"more or less\" similar to himself. He has memorized the entire map of Hades due to his constant attempts to escape, making him an invaluable resource for Zagreus.\n\nMisery builds character, implying that before his punishment, Sisyphus used to be a tyrant king, manipulative, and selfish, an intolerable individual, a poor king who had no fear of his own arrogance and considered himself smarter than the gods themselves. Sisyphus had nothing left to lose, so he reflected so much that he became a decent person, despite still trying to escape routinely.\n\nSisyphus is a robust man chained to a rock (Bouldy), dressed in tattered green clothes. His olive-brown hair is adorned on his head by a golden tiara resting on his forehead. Despite his lifeless state, the arduous effort and relentless whipping have left visible scars on his body, witnessing the enduring torment he endures.",

Oddly, no one in the House seems to be aware of his existence besides Zagreus and Achilles, unless the former asks them about him.\nSkelly has 900 HP.

He seems suspiciously enthusiastic about getting beaten up.\n\nSkelly, the excessively animated skeleton, remains a mysterious figure. Despite lacking flesh and blood, he eagerly assists Zagreus in mastering the use of weapons, serving as a willing punching bag for the prince's practice sessions. Surprisingly, Skelly finds joy in this role, deriving satisfaction from the experience.\n\nAlthough he is a skeleton, Skelly possesses a vibrant spirit. He is fiercely loyal and courageous, aiding Zagreus in his escapades behind Hades' back. Skelly tends to exhibit extreme behavior, being highly enthusiastic, talkative, and condescending towards those within earshot. He often engages in playful banter, even going as far as pretending to be capable of experiencing death to play pranks on Zagreus, much to the prince's amusement.\n\nSkelly is friendly and helpful by nature, but he has a tendency to quickly develop a sense of familiarity with others, as if he were an expert in the ways of war. Achilles disapproves of Skelly's imprudent advice and questions who Skelly might have been in life to possess such unwavering confidence in death. Additionally, Skelly exhibits a peculiar masochistic inclination, deriving pleasure from enduring blows.\n\nSkelly is depicted as a blue-white skeleton with vibrant red eyes and an expression of excitement. In an interesting departure from typical skeletal appearances, he possesses a few strands of black hair on the top of his head, accompanied by shaggy sideburns and an irregular ridge along his back. Notably, Skelly places a coin with the symbol of the House of Hades in his mouth. This unique combination of features further enhances Skelly's distinct appearance in the game.",

            "content": "Thanatos is the personification of death. He is one of Nyx's many children and the older twin brother of Hypnos.\n\nAs the embodiment of death, Thanatos has many duties requiring him to venture up into the mortal realm. His most recent such venture took longer than usual - speculated by Hypnos and Zagreus to be related to the ongoing war - but returns some time after the game's opening. He apparently dislikes the mortal realm, in particular how bright it can get.\n\nThanatos occasionally appears at the beginning of regular encounters and challenges Zagreus to see which of them can slay more shades. He is immune to damage during the contest, and will not retaliate if struck (he'll just complain). If Zagreus either kills more enemies than Thanatos does or ties his total, he will award Zagreus a Centaur Heart in addition to the regular room-clear reward.\n\nWithin the House of Hades, Thanatos can be found in the same hallway where Achilles keeps guard.\n\nThe embodiment of death, Thanatos prioritizes a job well done and likes to keep a perfect record. Despite his strong work ethic, this does not stop him from moving in the shadows, as Thanatos breaks his loyalty vow to the House of Hades by offering his support to Zagreus to help him escape.\n\nAs the personification of death, Thanatos represents the natural and non-violent end to mortal existence, removing life in a painless and expected way. He sees death as a compassionate friend responsible for taking souls to the end of their journey and treats it only as an aspect of his work.\n\nTo most in the Underworld, Thanatos is known as a chronic workaholic and a ruthless perfectionist: aloof, insensitive, and almost always in a bad mood. Even when he apologizes, his words can be harsh. However, Zagreus claims that beneath his prickly exterior, Thanatos can in truth be responsive, respectful, and even friendly when he so desires, deconstructing the \"ice king\" image his years of duty have cultivated. Thanatos is also reserved, does not open up easily, and does not share details about his private life unless they are related to his work. However, he is surprisingly talkative in combat, sometimes even announcing his next move. Zagreus considers listening to this to be a \"death sentence\" in its own way.\n\nThanatos has a strict code of conduct at work, especially when it comes to his twin brother Hypnos. Hypnos tends to be sloppy in his work, while Thanatos is methodical, solemn, and completes his tasks in an orderly manner. Thanatos tends to ignore or reprimand Hypnos, but he sees it as an incentive for his twin to improve. When Hypnos is at risk of losing his job, Thanatos intervenes. As Hypnos becomes more active in his tasks in the House, Thanatos secretly praises him, and even apologizes for how he's previously treated him.\n\nProud and hesitant, Thanatos is a \"tsundere\" who is not honest about his feelings, but also not good at hiding them, irrespective of his cool exterior. Everyone in the underworld seems to already know how he feels about Zagreus, whom he is said to \"adore\". He takes things extremely seriously, so when Zagreus says he wants to go further with their relationship, Thanatos asks him to clarify and hopes that Zagreus doesn't think he's joking. If Zagreus accepts Thanatos' offer, he needs to understand that Thanatos' distant and unsettling silence does not indicate indifference and Zagreus will have to deal with it as it is simply a part of his personality.\n\nThanatos is a figure with a grayish-brownish skin tone, though pale, slim, and slender, but sculpted with striking features and short silver hair that used to be long, now falling in strands around his face. He has dark circles around his eyes, with remarkable golden eyes that gleam with a supernatural light. He is generally seen with an apathetic expression.\n\nHis dark leather armor is adorned with golden wings, similar to his twin brother's, but with \"three\" ornaments instead of \"four,\" placed on just one shoulder. He wears a hood that covers the top of his head and frames his face, and his black cloak flows behind him as he moves gracefully and agilely. In his hand, he wields a black scythe with a sharp, curved blade that emits a purple light resembling an eye. Thanatos' physical appearance exudes a quiet and mysterious aura befitting his role as the God of Death.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Theseus is a former hero and king of Athens, most famous for slaying the Minotaur. He was recruited by Hades to help prevent Zagreus's escape. He fights alongside the Minotaur as the final boss of Elysium, and serves Elysium as its champion and its king.\n\nTheseus, often proclaiming himself as \"the great king of Athens,\" is a hot-headed, stubborn, and even childish ex-hero, but he is best known for his youthful exploits that were significant enough to earn him an immortal soul and boast for eternity in Elysium.\n\nTriumphant Theseus is a pompous and arrogant man, perpetually proud and confident in his victories. Most residents outside of Elysium can't stand him because of this. Theseus will occasionally shine during dialogue when he feels particularly proud of himself. The complete opposite of Achilles, Theseus is immodest and acts more like a schoolyard bully than a noble ex-hero.\n\nHe tends to interpret things to the extreme and dismiss evidence that doesn't fit his preconceived notions - thus, he will push Zagreus' buttons. In his mind, Zagreus is useless and not a true warrior, despite accumulating multiple victories against Theseus. Zagreus' attempts at conversation are taken as lies and deception, and he will not accept any provocation if Zagreus says that there are better Heroes than him.\n\nAn overly confident warrior in his winning streak, Theseus puts on a show for the crowd. He doesn't accept defeat and can behave in a dramatic and comically immature manner. When Zagreus defeats him in combat, Asterius becomes exasperated if Theseus continues to cry over Zagreus. But he has shown a noble and redeemable side, revealing that he used to be more modest, and deep down, he is a noble hero, as seen when he freed Asterius from his imprisonment and accepted him as a worthy comrade, sharing his champion title.\n\nDespite becoming a broken pedestal for Zagreus, there are enough hints scattered through dialogue that Theseus was indeed a great hero when he was still living: Hades speaks rather highly of him. Given how cynical he is, the fact that Hades continues to hold respect for him and gave him such a high station in Elysium is telling. Asterius' Undying Loyalty towards Theseus is rooted in the fact that it was thanks to Theseus that he was allowed to end up in Elysium. The Olympians offer Theseus their blessings. The Olympians are noted as being rather fickle, and despite both Poseidon and Dionysus considering Theseus to be a blowhard, they still view him as worthy of their blessings.\n\nHe and Asterius wear identical clothes, with the only difference being that Theseus keeps his left shoulder uncovered and wears a wide belt around his waist. He is a muscular man who overdid the tan, his blond hair styled back (which in the past was long, similar to Achilles'), and he always maintains a confident expression on his face. His height is similar to Zagreus'. He can transform into a sophisticated battle outfit that includes a golden mask and ammunition on his chest.\n\nThe Portrait, Exalted Hero item depics Theseus in his youth. In it, he dorns a blue cape with yellow details and a cloak pin with the Zodiac symbol of Taurus, more likely a reference to his connection with bulls throughout many of the stories related to him rather than that being his actual Zodiac sign. His hair is longer and his skin isn't as tanned as it is in-game. His right arm is cover in some red fabric hold together with line by the elbow.",

She is the sister of Alecto and Megaera, she does not initially appear in the game, as both she and Alecto are busy with matters in the mortal world. Tisiphone is responsible for punishing those who have committed murder.\n\nAfter Megaera has been defeated a certain number of times, Alecto and Tisiphone will begin appearing, randomly substituting her in Tartarus. Tisiphone does not appear in the House of Hades after she's been defeated.\n\nOne of the relentless Fury sisters, Tisiphone is the most emotional and mentally unstable of the three sisters, and \"murder\" and \"murderer\" are the only words she can say. Like her sisters, she prevents Zagreus from reaching his destiny.\n\nDue to her limited vocabulary, there may be errors in interpretation, as she was specifically assigned to torment those who committed \"murder\" in their mortal lives.\n\nShe tends to take things seriously and reacts strongly to anything that disturbs her. As a result, she is often the target of teasing, especially by Zagreus, who seems to consider her just a little shy, and who will constantly try to add a new word to her vocabulary.\n\nShe is obsessed with her work, like Megaera and Alecto, who also take their work seriously, although she is not as sadistic as Alecto. Tisiphone practically lives for it. Zagreus and Meg wonder if this amount of work has led her to her current state of madness.\n\nIn contrast to her sisters, Tisiphone's face resembles that of a withered corpse. She has black eyes with bright yellowish green ascleres and a catatonic expression. Tisiphone has pale skin and foggy light green hair, with a single wing protruding from her back that appears to be blue from a different angle. Her eyes are piercing green, and she has prominent cheekbones. She wears a similar outfit to her sisters, but in green. Her forearms are wrapped in bandages, and she wields a large whip-like weapon. She exudes an aura of ferocity and anger, fitting for her role as one of the enforcers of punishment in the Underworld.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Zagreus, Prince of the Underworld, is the son of Hades.\nZagreus has always had a sense that he doesn't belong in the House of Hades. Sometime before the start of the game he decides, against his father's will, to escape from the Underworld\u2014no matter how many tries it might take him. He is aided and encouraged in his journey, primarily by his caretaker Nyx and his mentor Achilles. Others outside the House of Hades, such as Sisyphus, Charon, and the Olympians sometimes offer their aid as well.\n\nZagreus is met with numerous obstacles throughout the realms of Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium, and the Temple of Styx. He is mostly faced with various aggressive shades working for his father, but he also has run-ins with the Furies (Alecto , Tisiphone and Megaera), the skeletal remains of the Lernaean Hydra, and the champion of Elysium, Theseus, and his friend, Asterius, in order to arrive at the Temple of Styx. These battles, combined with the dangerous landscape of the Underworld, serve to bring a painful end to Zagreus's escape attempts sooner or later.\n\nZagreus is the Prince of the Underworld and the rebellious son of Hades. His personality does not reflect anything from the place he comes from. Zagreus is characterized by his good humor, humility, kindness, and relentless persistence, with a tendency towards self-deprecation and a complex about the fact that he \"bleeds red.\" Having spent most of his immortal life enduring frustration and repressed anger from his toxic upbringing, Zagreus is determined and will do anything to escape his infernal prison.\n\nIn an existential crisis, Zagreus discovers that his entire life had no purpose, struggling to meet his father's expectations and feeling useless to the House for not being able to contribute to the functioning of the Underworld, feeling distant and alienated among the other inhabitants of Hades and having \"nothing to call his own.\" Despite this, he finds purpose when he discovers the existence of his true mother, long lost, Persephone, and decides to escape the realm of the dead to find answers about her and himself.\n\nZagreus is an all-loving hero, a social magnet, a charismatic, captivating, and sociable young man, who easily befriends many he encounters, treating those of lower status as equals and often using his own influence to improve their lives, respecting the elders (except his father) and other gods. He is subtle, but his gregarious attitude and desire to please everyone suggest a strong paternal void in Zagreus, a result of his emotionally distant relationship with his father. His desire to form a good relationship with everyone he meets becomes a point of the plot. Zagreus is magnetic and will make friends and allies wherever he goes, leaving a trail of tumult in the Underworld.\n\nZagreus does his best to get along with everyone and claims not to hate anyone. However, as long as they don't bother him too much like \"Theseus,\" even with Hypnos, confessing that he was mean to him, he is friendlier the next time he sees him. He is somewhat blas\u00e9, with his confident sarcasm leading him to offend those around him, often acting without thinking about the consequences. However, he always reflects on his actions and quickly apologizes when he crosses the line. Zagreus is stubborn, and his interactions with Meg and Than tend to exasperate them due to his annoying persistent escape. Zagreus is known for not taking commitments seriously, even joking about it.\n\nThough he is an elite warrior in his own right and takes enjoyment in battle, Zagreus often admits to feeling conflicted when it comes to fighting the inhabitants of the Temple of Styx. This is likely because unlike the other enemies in the game that can be fought who are already dead and will eventually regenerate after being destroyed, the Satyr Cultists and the Gigantic Vermin are still alive, and by killing them he feels that he's robbing them of their lives even though they'll all eventually end up in the Underworld anyway regardless of whether he fights them or not. This shows that while Zagreus enjoys a good fight, he takes no pleasure in the more violent aspects of combat.\n\nDue to his sheltered upbringing, Zagreus is honest and also incredibly naive and innocent about the surface world, to the point of questioning the existence of birds, relying on others to convey information, acquire knowledge, and understand the world beyond his reach.\n\nBefore gifting Zagreus his codex, Achilles makes note of Zagreus' apparent love for history. During a fight with Theseus, if a certain Pact of Punishment has been applied, he even recognizes the chariot that Theseus rides just at a glance.\n\nDue to his mortal heritage, Zagreus is somewhat small for a god, considerably shorter than Hades and about a head shorter than Persephone. Presumably, he has an average height for a mortal, as he tells the Minotaur that he is the same height as Theseus. He has heterochromia, with one eye being his father's red and the other his mother's green. His black hair is like his father's, but with his mother's spiky texture. His skin is quite pale (tanned by underworld standards), and he is physically strong and muscular. His feet are perpetually on fire. Zagreus is well-sculpted, so much so that even Aphrodite takes note of him. Although he is considered thin for a god and has been called skinny, he would be considered above average in size by mortal standards. It seems he strangely bleeds red.\n\nZagreus wears a red and black toga, hanging over his left shoulder with his right chest exposed. He also wears a white belt, visually resembling bone, with skulls carved into it. On his left shoulder is a metallic shoulder plate resembling the three heads of Cerberus biting onto his shoulder. He has red ribbons wrapped in an x-pattern on his right arm and two thin leather bracelets on his left forearm, one near his wrist and the other near his elbow. He also wears blood red trousers. On the crown of his head is a small laurel wreath, starting as red at the base of his head and turning to golden yellow near the front. The front yellow leaves of his laurel wreath are often depicted floating around his head.",

            "content": "Zeus is the god of the sky and thunder, and the ruler of the Olympian Gods, Zeus is Hades's younger brother and Zagreus's uncle. He offers boons to his nephew which give his abilities chain lightning or lightning strikes.\n\nZeus' boons excel at dealing damage to groups of enemies, as chain lightning effects bounce between enemies, and lightning strikes can hit multiple enemies.\n\nHis signature Status Curse is Jolted, which causes enemies to inflict damage to themselves when they attack, consuming the Curse.\n\nThe King of the Olympians, Zeus appears gregarious, affable, and especially paternal, in contrast to his brusque brother. However, this is only superficially. While his brother Hades is well-intentioned and fair beneath his exterior, Zeus is the opposite. In his essence, Zeus can be quite cunning, superb, displays a superiority complex, and possibly has the most inflated ego of the Olympians.\n\nZeus tries to act like a benevolent god, but even his acts of \"kindness\" are rooted in what pleases him. He is not afraid of the consequences of his actions and never takes responsibility. He seems unable to acknowledge that he participated, does not listen to others, and is always making fun of serious matters.\n\nZeus tends to act compassionate with Zagreus, offering encouragement, but he is also somewhat self-centered. He forces everyone to say something good about him, about how he is \"the most elegant, powerful, and divine of the gods.\" and can joke about his nephew having a \"Celestial Revenge\" if he accepts another benefit.\n\nZeus can be quite cynical, like when he likes to mention Demeter's missing daughter in their family conversations and commenting blatantly about how lamentable the whole case is, while acting as if he's just as perplexed as the others. However, he is absolutely aware that he is entirely responsible for the kidnapping of Persephone. His audacity also leads him to send his nephew to send a message to his father on his behalf, saying that \"Zeus forgives him,\" maddening Hades with fury with his contradictory insolence, despite having caused the all problem in question.\n\nZeus in his splendor is not purely selfish, as he was when he saved the cosmos by waging war against the Titans and dividing the world almost fairly with his brothers. He very much wanted to reconnect with Hades and liked Zagreus, wishing him as a son. Although in the most wrong way possible, he certainly saw Persephone as a \"gift\". Zeus realized that his older brother was alone in the underworld, liked Persephone, and that she reciprocated and wanted to leave Olympus. So he staged the kidnapping with her and brought her to Hades, in part to fix things with him and reconcile, however radical the approach.\n\nZeus appears as an imposing, elderly man with a tan skin tone and a loose robe revealing his musclebound chest. His hair and beard are stark white and emulate the clouds of his heavenly domain. He is armed with his signature lightning bolt, alongside two other bolts worn in his hair as a laurel wreath. He also adorns golden bracelets and rings.",

The Olympians bound them afterwards to prevent their use, but the arms are supposedly the strongest or some of the strongest weapons that exist in the universe which is why they are supposed to be locked away. Why exactly they appear in the courtyard is unknown, but some of the weapon descriptions found in the Codex suggests Achilles might have had some influence. Because of their history with titan blood they both react to it when it is collected and seem to have developed some form of consciousness.\n\nEach weapon has a hidden aspect based on myths from a culture other than Greece, which requires a secret phrase to 'wake' it and reveal the option. The spear's aspect must be unlocked first; once it is revealed, revealing the others becomes possible. (Paying to unlock the spear's hidden aspect is not necessary.) Each phrase comes from a different character, and does not require that the correct weapon be wielded while interacting with that character. However, several weapons require that you first have a conversation with the same character while wielding the correct weapon, and only after that conversation occurs is the later conversation with the secret phrase accessible. In most cases the character who conveys the phrase is thematically related to the weapon and therefore can be guessed. (It is not possible for the player to enter the phrases manually, Zagreus must learn them diegetically.)\n\nFor the spear, Zagreus must have reached the surface and must unlock several aspects of his various weapons. For the others, substantial upgrades of the weapon in question are required. Details appear below, collapsed for those who prefer to discover it themselves, organized in approximate ascending order of difficulty.",

Another use for the sigil is discovered during Nyx's Favor.\n\nThe Permanent Record tracks the aggregate information about Zagreus' escape attempts. It lists how many times he has used and escaped with each of his weapons, how many times he has accepted each Olympian boon, how many times he has taken each Daedalus hammer upgrade, which weapon aspects he has used (other than his own), and how many times he has used each keepsake/companion.\n\nThe Security Log accurately records information about each of Zagreus' various escape attempts. This information includes: the attempt number; its outcome; how long it took; how much heat was used; what weapon (and aspect), keepsake, and companion he used; and an exact list of his boons and their levels.",

            "content": "The Twin Fists of Malphon are one of the Infernal Arms that can be unlocked for 8 Chthonic Keys after unlocking the first four weapons.\n\nThe primary attack of the Twin Fists is a set of low damage, but extremely fast, strikes that chain together in sets of five. The special is an uppercut that does more damage and hits twice. One unique feature of the Twin Fists is that there is a separate special attack that can be used as part of a dash, which only hits once but at a higher base damage. Additionally, it receives Dash-Strike damage bonuses as well as Special damage bonuses.\n\nThe Twin Fists have 4 Aspects: Zagreus, Talos, Demeter and Gilgamesh. Like all other weapons, each Aspect has 5 levels that can be unlocked by spending Titan Blood. The higher the level of the Aspect, the more effective its improvement is. Reaching the highest level in all Aspects requires 51 Titan Blood. An Aspect will not only change the appearance of the Twin Fists, but will also improve its attacks. The Aspect of Gilgamesh has an unique move-set which changes the fighting style of the Twin Fists.",

These bullets do not stagger enemies or cause them to flinch, and they deal low damage. Zagreus is immobile while firing.\n\nWhen the Rail is out of ammo, it must be reloaded. It will reload automatically when releasing the attack button while out of ammo. A manual reload can be triggered with the \"Reload\" action.\n\nThe Rail's special is \"Bombard\". Using it targets an area around the cursor and launches a large grenade at it. After a brief delay, the grenade will hit the targeted area, dealing massive damage to enemies within the blast zone. The grenade will bounce back from walls and obstacles.\n\nThe Adamant Rail has 4 Aspects: Zagreus, Eris, Hestia, and Lucifer. Like all other weapons, each Aspect has 5 levels that can be unlocked by spending Titan Blood. The higher the level of the Aspect, the more effective its improvement is.

The reward for each chamber is visible on its entrance door, and is obtained after clearing the chamber.\n\nMost of the Chambers will be Encounters with waves of enemies. Once all waves of enemies have been defeated, the room's reward will appear to be collected, and entrance doors to the next chamber(s) will unlock.\n\nSome encounters are more difficult than others, denoted by a skull underneath the reward symbol on the room's door. These are encounters with increased rewards such as double Darkness rooms, Trial of the Gods, and mini-boss / boss encounters.\n\nAll normal encounters have a chance of spawning an Infernal Trove, Well of Charon, Pool of Purging, Chaos Gate, or Infernal Gate, which will open after the reward has been collected. Some of these can be forcefully spawned in with items from the Well of Charon.\n\nChamber rewards are denoted on their entrance door by a symbol surrounded by an either blue or yellow laurel wreath. Blue Laurels accompany persistent resources (Keys, Darkness, Gemstone, and Nectar) that can be traded or used to unlock new weapons, power up the Mirror of Night, or earn Keepsakes. Gold Laurels represent rewards that impact the current run, such as Obols, Boons, and Centaur Hearts.\n\nThe presence of a skull symbol on a room reward indicates increased difficulty and enhanced rewards. Persistent rewards and Pom strength are doubled, while Boons are more likely to be of higher rarity.",

Great heroes such as Achilles are far more likely to be allowed to keep their physical forms then, say for example, a simple farmhand who died as a result of mishap. Major villains such as Sisyphus and other beings like Eurydice are also shown to keep their bodies after death.\n\nThough it is possible to destroy a Shade's physical form, this is ultimately only a minor inconvenience for them as the Shade in question will eventually regenerate itself in the same chamber of the Underworld where it was last defeated.\n\nIn some cases, a Shade after being sorted into one of the locations of the Underworld will begin to physically change into monsters known as the Perilous Foes so as to better reflect the actions that they had committed in life.",

Achilles hoped that by giving the book to Zagreus, he could encourage the prince's love of history to grow, rather than only teaching him how to fight.\n\nThe Codex functions as a semi-magical record of Achilles' own travels and experience, both on the surface (e.g. with the Olympian Gods) and in the Underworld; therefore, it is not unbiased or objective, but is written from Achilles' point of view, and references his personal opinions, relationships, history, and understanding. As Zagreus encounters, gathers, speaks to, or slays the subjects of the Codex, he is able to access Achilles' knowledge more deeply, and the entries become more complete.\n\nThe Codex also serves as a reference of how many bottles of Nectar and Ambrosia have been gifted to certain characters, via a row of hearts in the top right corner of their entries. Characters have between 5 to 10 hearts.\n\nThough the Codex is obtainable at any time after Zagreus' third escape attempt, Achilles may not hand it over right away - multiple conversations may be required to trigger the correct event. The Codex cannot be opened prior to obtaining it.",

Shortly after, it will launch a bright purple projectile into the air which falls in an arc, causing a large AoE explosion when they come into contact with the ground. The damage done by these will only affect Zagreus, unlike the traps created by Wretched Pests. Also unlike Pests, Bothers will move continuously, rather than try to hide and blend in.\n\nA large red indicator showing the landing spot of the projectile and the entire area affected appears as soon as they are fired.\n\nThe projectiles can be deflected, but only when they are close to the ground, which happens when they have either just been fired or about to land.\n\nA larger, tougher Bother will serve as a possible encounter at the end of one of the Satyr Tunnels. This Bother will send several blasts out at once, surrounding itself in a wide radius to discourage players from getting close enough to attack.",

            "content": "The kingdom of the dead, where all souls go for eternity; it was formerly ruled over by the Primordial goddess Nyx before she chose to peacefully step down in favor of the Olympian god Hades.\n\nThere are six main rivers that are visible both in the living world and the Underworld:\n\n1. The Styx is generally considered to be one of the most prominent and central rivers of the Underworld and is also the most widely known out of all the rivers. It's known as the river of hatred and is named after the goddess Styx. This river circles the Underworld seven times.\n2. The Acheron is the river of pain. It's the one that Charon, also known as the Ferryman, rows the dead over.\n3. The Lethe is the river of forgetfulness. It is often associated with the goddess Lethe, the goddess of forgetfulness and oblivion.\n4. The Phlegethon is the river of fire. This river leads to the depths of Tartarus.\n5. The Cocytus is the river of wailing.\n6. Oceanus is the river that encircles the world, and it marks the east edge of the Underworld.\n\nTemple of Styx: Once a majestic temple dedicated to honoring all of the deities (chthonic gods, death gods, etc.) of the Underworld, in more recent years the temple has fallen into a state of disrepair. It is notable for being the only way in or out of the Underworld with Achilles mentioning that no other known entrance exists in the world.\n\nElysium: The final resting place of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous in the Underworld.\n\nAsphodel Meadows: The section of the Underworld where the souls of people who lived lives of equal good and evil rest.\n\nTartarus: The section of the Underworld where people who were evil during their lives are sent to face eternal punishment for their crimes after death.\n\nHouse of Hades: A lavish estate located in the very heart of Tartarus. It is home to most of the Chthonic gods and is also where all the newly deceased souls gather to be judged by Hades personally.\n\nErebus: A dark forgotten corner of Tartarus which appears to be only accessible via an Infernal Gate, it is home to all of the mythological monsters whether evil, neutral or good who have been slain. And may also be home to the Shades who were unfortunate enough to not have any coins on them when they died, as Charon in Greek mythology would refuse to give a soul passage to the rest of the Underworld without proper payment first.\n\nNotably the Minotaur Asterius was stated to have ended up in Erebus after his death before Theseus was able to convince Hades to allow him into Elysium.\n\nIt's also implied that Charon might reside in Erebus when off duty, as whenever Zagreus tries to steal from him, the ferryman teleports them both to a specialized dojo like area in Erebus so he can beat up the prince as punishment.\n\nChaos Gates: Located even deeper than Tartarus itself, the strange realm which the primordial Chaos chooses to call home has long been a source of mystery and intrigue both among mortals and deities alike. Many have speculated what hidden secrets may lie within just waiting to be discovered, but very few have ever managed to successfully reach it to find out and even fewer have ever returned to tell exactly what it is they've found there.",

Megaera will only be present in the House after an escape attempt in which she was killed; the same is true of Thanatos, once he returns to the underworld.\n\nThere is apparently a rule against violence within the House, as Megaera is not permitted to harm Zagreus (no matter how much she might like to). This may be part of why neither Alecto nor Tisiphone are permitted within the House; both Achilles and Megaera claim neither of them have \"earned the right\". Achilles further states that the two have no desire to \"exist here with the rest of us\", and their less-sensible dispositions makes them more suited elsewhere.",

He was dipped in the Styx by his mother as a child to grant him immortality but was left vulnerable on the heel by which Thetis held him.\n\nAfter he was fatally wounded when Paris shot his heel with an arrow, he descended to the Underworld as a Shade, where he was eventually hired by Hades to train a young Zagreus in battle and military discipline in exchange for allowing his lover Patroclus into Elysium. Since he was hired, Achilles has made an effort to be a source of support and encouragement for Zagreus in the face of Hades' often harsh treatment.\n\nAchilles is responsible for authoring all entries in the Codex, which he gives to Zagreus to provide information and guidance about the Underworld and the Olympian Gods.\n\nAchilles is portrayed as a well-built adult male with a height similar to Patroclus. He has curly, light blond hair that is combed to the left side and back, and he wears a braided headband as an adornment. He is often seen wielding his spear. His cloak, known as a chlamys, is green and matches the design of Patroclus', except for the motif on his cloak pin, which displays the symbol of the House of Hades. His silver chest armor extends into a belt adorned with a Greek meander pattern. Underneath his armor, he wears a white tunic, known as a chiton, covered by a green waist wrap that transitions into a long skirt called a himation. His left arm is adorned with a silver bracelet, while his right arm is partially covered by his cloak. Achilles also wears bracers with hand guards, presumably made of metal and leather strips, as well as golden shin guards. He is depicted as being barefooted.",

Alecto does not appear in the House of Hades after she has been defeated.\n\nAlecto is the deadliest of the Furies and loves the chance to make Zagreus bleed, often dubbing him \"Red Blood\" due to the vivid color. She acts on impulsive passions and always torments those who do not give in to their own passions. She is anxious about the possibility of repeatedly killing a god, as she has always wanted to play with one.\n\nShe loves to fight and believes she is the ace of the Furies. Alecto is extremely open about her emotions, in contrast to Megaera. She fights trespassers around the clock like her sister, but unlike Meg, Alecto is sadistic by nature, insane, violent, and sees her work more as a sport, always sporting a Hellish grin.\n\nAlecto is fierce and quite provocative, but she cannot resist being provoked by others, often falling into her own traps.\n\nDespite her temper and preference for working alone, she has shown some degree of protectiveness towards Tisiphone.\n\nAlecto is a fierce and imposing figure with a muscular physique. She has a single wing protruding from her back, which appears green from certain angles. Her sharp smile and pale skin contrast with her spiked bronze hair cascading down her back. Her piercing red eyes, prominent cheekbones, and strong jawline give her a menacing appearance. Like her sisters, she wears a matching red outfit adorned with spikes and silver details. Her forearms are wrapped in bandages, and she wields a large whip-like green weapon. Alecto exudes an aura of intense fury and wrath, perfect for her role as one of the enforcers of punishment.",

She offers boons to Zagreus that inflict her signature Status Curse, Weak, or make enemies more susceptible to damage.\n\nAphrodite boons not only increase your damage significantly, offering the largest additive damage boosts for your Attack and Special, but also your survivability, making enemy attacks less effective as you fight them. Due to Weak effects being easy to inflict, Aphrodite also enables synergy with the Mirror of Night Upgrade, Privileged Status.\n\nAphrodite is playful, seductive, and optimistic. As the Goddess of Love, she can be very sweet and accessible with Zagreus and her admirers, and openly flirts with them. However, it's not a good idea to irritate her by insinuating second intentions. She will express her anger against anyone who threatens those she considers important or \"her little god.\"\n\nDespite being the goddess of love, she can be quite venomous, mischievous, and prone to making lethal comments. Comments from other Olympian gods indicate that Aphrodite has shallow interests. She can be quite hypocritical, and frequently conflicts with other Olympians, especially Athena, who are like water and wine. However, she firmly believes in the power of love and will do everything to ensure that it is given and received in its purest form.\n\nEven the love expert can make mistakes, and her quickness to perceive passions is not always accurate. For example, she wrongly deduces that the shy Artemis was interested in Zagreus, causing a misunderstanding. Aphrodite is a confidant of love and can be well-intentioned at times, acting as a counselor for broken hearts and assisting pending passions.\n\nAphrodite uses her status as the goddess of love to her advantage, with her charm and charisma, taking advantage of the benefits this provides, using people's passions and desires at your pleasure, making her a skilled strategist in both love and battle. Achilles remarks that, among the Olympians, Aphrodite terrifies him the most. Her domain can cause great turbulence with more devastating consequences than a lightning bolt, literally destroying the hearts of her adversaries.\n\nHer signature Status Curse is Weak, which reduces the afflicted enemies' damage by 30%. Aphrodite also offers boons which increase the effectiveness of her Status Curse itself, such as Empty Inside (which increases the effect's duration).\n\nThe most feminine goddess of Olympus, Aphrodite exudes a confident and seductive aura and is depicted with small vegetables adorning her head. She is depicted unabashedly, as a voluptuous nude goddess with peach-colored eyes and a defined jawline. She is adorned on the sides of her head with decorative vegetation brooches, with jewelry intertwined on her wrists and ankles. Her incredible long silky peach-colored hair covers her breasts and pubic area, with its ends entwining in a heart shape.",

            "content": "Ares is the Olympian God of war. Unlike the more strategically oriented Athena, Ares' domain is the physical, violent, and untamed aspects of warfare.\n\nHe offers boons to Zagreus, which can increase his ability damage, inflict his signature Status Curse, Doom, or create Blade Rifts which deal rapid damage to enemies who walk into them.\n\nAres boons deal high amounts of damage over time, either by keeping enemies inside Blade Rifts, or by continuously applying Doom to enemies.\n\nHis signature Status Curse is Doom, which causes enemies to take a large amount of damage shortly after being inflicted, consuming the Curse. Ares also offers boons which increase the effectiveness of his Status Curse itself, such as Dire Misfortune.\n\nAres is a lover of war and chaos, and while he may have a calm and courteous demeanor, he revels in the chaos of battle. As the Blood Knight, he is willing to aid his cousin Zagreus in his struggles in the Underworld, leading him to sow a chaotic trail wherever he goes in his name.\n\nOther Olympians are not particularly fond of Ares, and may curse him for his weak compliments. They find his thirst for polite carnage disconcerting. Ares is very confident, even arrogant, about his boons and often boasts about how his boons are better or will help Zagreus more than those of other gods, particularly Athena's. They see Ares as a terrible influence on Zagreus. Aphrodite, on the other hand, doesn't seem to mind and considers him a \"bad boy\".\n\nThe God of War is often misunderstood by his fellow Olympians. Artemis, in particular, finds Ares' conversations \"embarrassing\", as he always let's slip his \"peculiar tastes\" and prefers to keep her distance from him, with his attempts to start a conversation always ending in disaster. He secretly admires the Chthonic Gods for their darker roles, and he is the only Olympian who treats them beyond cold affability. Unfortunately, his joy in death is not even shared by the Chthonic gods, who see it more as a mundane aspect of their work.\n\nIn conversation with Chaos, it is revealed that surprisingly, Ares is one of the few who still venerates them. However, it is implied that Ares' worship of \"chaos\" was misguided, as he confused it with the vast and infinite void of violence and disorder. He also mentions having studied \"all the designs of fate\" and is the only god to express familiarity with Excalibur, implying he knows much more about the future than Athena does.\n\nAres is described as a powerful man with broad shoulders, a dark skin tone, and white warpaint over his eyes. He is dressed in a complex set of heavy battle armor and a badly tattered cape. However, his golden helmet is damaged with a large red \"X\" carved into the forehead, and he holds it in his arms, revealing his white hair, strong jawline, and black-leafed victory laurel. Ares is armed with a red-edged Kopis, along with two other swords strapped to his back. His body armor appears to be themed around a vulture, one of his sacred animals, with a large raven's-face motif on his breast, alongside black feather-like decorations tucked into his shoulderpieces.",

In addition, she also offers boons that improve Cast abilities.\n\nWhile the damage bonus offered on her boons is lower compared to other Gods', the Critical hits they offer deal three times the damage of a normal ability, granting some of the best overall DPS gain offered by any single god or goddess. Artemis boons, when properly combined with other boons, have the potential to deal tremendous damage. In addition, her Cast related boons increase your total ammo or add a projectile, further enabling a powerful ranged tool.\n\nHer signature Status Curse is Marked, which increases the chance of dealing a critical hit to the afflicted enemy, consuming the Curse and reapplying it to a nearby target. This essentially allows you to snowball critical hits in a crowd. This increase in chance will stack with her boons that offer Critical hit chance.\n\nArtemis is taciturn, unsociable, and indifferent to her Olympian family. As a goddess associated with hunting and a master archer, she prefers to retreat to the forest and be alone or with her nymphs, hunting or engaging in activities that do not involve social interaction or spending too much time with her noisy and complicated family.\n\nA stoic goddess who prefers to associate with nature through her hunting and hide in own privaty world. Artemis is seen as \"a lone she-wolf.\" As noted by other gods, she is socially awkward, which may be due to her presence as the goddess of the wilderness or the lack of social interaction due to her frequent nocturnal outings.\n\nArtemis appears as a lithe, young maiden with green-tinted hair and skin, adorned with a variety of close-fitting animal skins alongside a green hunting cape and a large quiver. Her hair is worn in a single large plait and crowned with a pair of animal horns, specifically those of a deer, one of her sacred animals, and her association with the moon can be seen in the crescent symbols worn in her hair and on her breast. She is seen armed with a large wooden bow with a trio of quails perched on one end.",

He remains calm, modest, rational, and emotionally balanced, knowing when to lose and not taking his fights personally like Theseus does.\n\nHe and Theseus wear matching outfits, and like Theseus, he wears a short chiton with a large belt around his waist.

As the goddess of wisdom and military strategy, Athena sincerely wishes for her cousin to escape his unjust imprisonment with an elaborate plan.\n\nDespite the best intentions, comments from Olympians indicate that Athena is a kind of \"know-it-all,\" an \"unbearable genius\" who considers her ideas superior to others. Artemis remarks that she never knows for sure whether Athena is trying to prove something or show off. Other Olympian gods indicate that she is somewhat fawning and that her benevolence is just an act.\n\nIn fact, beneath all her apparent benevolence, Athena is far from as wise as one might expect from a goddess of wisdom, having her own hidden depths and may have made serious mistakes in her past. Chaos speculates that the true reason Athena is carrying everything on her shoulders and is so eager to help Zagreus escape the underworld is that she sees him as a form of personal redemption, viewing him \"as a tool with which her broken family can still be fixed\" and to correct the rift between Olympian and chthonic gods.\n\nAthena appears as an imposing warrior figure, tall and upright with a dark grey skin tone, posing like a statue, with lavender braided hair and matching eyes. She wears a radiant collection of golden armor with a Gorgon stamped on the hip and lightweight robes, crowned with a blue helmet with a horsehair crest.

Chaos seems to derive amusement from this, perhaps out of boredom or sheer curiosity. They brand Dionysus as \"the drunk,\" for his unpredictability and thus act as a source of amusement for them. Chaos will make sensitive, critical comments about the people that Zagreus meets, sometimes having knowledge of secrets known to very few due to their eternal watch over reality. They seem to despise the Olympians and help Zagreus purely out of self-interest, rather than loyalty. Composed, their decisions are mysterious, and Chaos doesn't like to be talked about unless they request it. When engaged in dialogue with another, often Zagreus, they will prompt the individual directly at the end of their statement by saying \"Answer.\" Nevertheless, Chaos makes it known that they do not or will not compel the individual to answer, as that is their own choice to make.\n\nChaos cannot be measured or quantified in any meaningful way. Furthermore, leaving their realm would potentially destabilize all of order and existence, so they just decide to watch. They were distant in their role as a parent to Nyx, much to her dismay, and after much reflection during the events of the game, they later reveal to Zagreus their remorse for this.\n\nChaos resides within the Chaos Gates sometimes found within chambers.\n\nWhile the other gods could pass for human, or at least human-like, it's immediately clear that Chaos is not of this world, yet even they have some human characteristics. Their skin is gray higher up on their body, gradually darkening to dark yellow further down, and then becoming featureless black and brown.\n\nThe closest Chaos has to \"normal\" in their appearance is their human head and torso. Bat-like wings are where their ears should be, and in the middle of their chest is a red stone or eye. Another large eye is on their forehead, and on that eye itself, two smaller eyes can be seen.\n\nWhere Chaos's abdomen and lower torso would be, and circling up their chest and behind their head, is a tangle of red-eyed, melted-together human heads, including one that's missing its upper half above the nose. Mixed in with this mass are a few bones, small plants (some with red leaves, some the same color of Chaos's skin), and a human fetus, eventually trailing down into a dark, indistinct shape. On the right side of their body is the edge of what seems to be a robe, which blends back into the mishmash of flesh and faces.\n\nA starry background is seen behind Chaos, and behind their head are two shapes reminiscent of a human eye, one having many colors and the other gold, all symbolizing their existence outside reality as we know it while watching our reality from beyond. Held in Chaos's right hand, between their index finger and thumb and the size of a large marble in comparison to their hand, is the planet Earth.",

In Greek mythology, he required a single obol - placed into the mouth before burial - as payment for his services, or else the soul in question would be left to wander the banks of the Styx for a hundred years.\nCharon's services in-game are, unfortunately, much more expensive; he functions as the game's shopkeeper, selling Zagreus various power-ups, healing items, and boons in return for the obols he collects throughout his escape attempt. He can be found in chambers with a preview showing a brown sack, usually around the mid-length of each biome before a mini-boss encounter and at the penultimate chamber of a biome, before the boss encounter.\n\nHe also operates the Wells of Charon which can be randomly found throughout the Underworld.\n\nHe doesn't say much, communicating only in groans of various intonations, which Zagreus appears to either understand or enjoy interpreting in humorous ways. Zagreus often expresses annoyance that Charon apparently either cannot or will not simply ferry him up to the surface in his boat.\n\nWhile all the gods (except Chaos) can use Charon's shop to offer their boons to Zagreus, Hermes is the only god with whom Charon has a lasting professional relationship.\n\nCharon appears as a seedy, shadowy floating figure, he always carries his oar, and sometimes uses it as an unlikely weapon. He wears a large hat that obscures his face, revealing only one of his eyes that appears a vivid purple light. His long clothes are lined with coins collected from his salary, the obols. His hair is dirty blond and wavy, similar to Hypnos but not curly like his brother, he exudes smoky purple air coming out of his mouth when he breathes.",

In addition to that, she offers the 2nd highest raw percentage damage increase. Her other boons vary between helping survivability by healing, increasing damage, or boosting your different boons over time by increasing their rarity.\n\nDemeter boons excel at control, as Chill slows enemies down the more Zagreus strikes them. Since Chill is easy to stack and maintain, this also enables good synergy with the Mirror of Night Upgrade, Privileged Status.\n\nLady Demeter, the Goddess of Harvest, Agriculture, and Seasons, was once benevolent, hardworking, strong-willed, and protective. However, her pain and grief over losing her beloved daughter Persephone resulted in the infamous \"Endless Winter,\" causing her to take on a more wintry appearance and bitter personality.\n\nAs a mother, she was kind but overly controlling, keeping her daughter on a tight leash out of fear for her safety. Due to Persephone's mortal heritage, she saw her as fragile, and refused to consider her feelings, not even listening when she tried to tell her about Hades. Her overprotection led to a rift between them.\n\nDemeter's appearance is themed around winter and ebbing life. She is an elderly woman with blue lips and silvery-white hair worn in twin braids that cross her chest and loop back over the opposite shoulder. Six shoots of pale blue wheat frame her head, and she wears icicle-like earrings and ornaments that resemble snowflakes above her head. Her blue robe is flecked with a frost-like pattern on the abdomen, and her cape is made of snow with large blue snowflakes on its shoulders. Her forearms are mostly covered in ice, with only her digits and small parts of her forearms having visible skin, and she wears a small ring or bit of snow on her left ring finger. The only bits of green on her person are her eyes and the green ribbon she holds, which looks much like Persephone's hair ribbon. A cornucopia, covered in snow and containing no food, appears behind her.",

Hangover can be stacked onto an enemy up to a base amount of 5 times, and stacks wear off one at a time after 4 seconds.\n\nDionysus is the god of wine, revelry, and madness. He is usually very receptive, fun-loving, and playful, and he joins in helping Zagreus try to escape because he finds Zag entertaining to watch while drinking a good wine. Even his speech tends to be a little slurred, as if he's always a little drunk.\n\nThe god of parties is uninhibited and wears a short, wide, smoky purple chiton. His sprite poses him in a way that shows off his chiseled body. He wears gold bracelets on his wrists and thighs and adorns his shoulders with vines and animal skin. His garments often emulate the plant and bunches of grapes in the curls of his hair. In his right hand he carries his staff of fennel adorned with a pine cone, the so-called thyrsus\u2014symbol of prosperity, fertility, and hedonism.
