The Styx is generally considered to be one of the most prominent and central rivers of the Underworld and is also the most widely known out of all the rivers.

It is often associated with the goddess Lethe, the goddess of forgetfulness and oblivion.\n4. The Phlegethon is the river of fire. This river leads to the depths of Tartarus.\n5. The Cocytus is the river of wailing.\n6. Oceanus is the river that encircles the world, and it marks the east edge of the Underworld.\n\nTemple of Styx: Once a majestic temple dedicated to honoring all of the deities (chthonic gods, death gods, etc.) of the Underworld, in more recent years the temple has fallen into a state of disrepair. It is notable for being the only way in or out of the Underworld with Achilles mentioning that no other known entrance exists in the world.\n\nElysium: The final resting place of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous in the Underworld.\n\nAsphodel Meadows: The section of the Underworld where the souls of people who lived lives of equal good and evil rest.\n\nTartarus: The section of the Underworld where people who were evil during their lives are sent to face eternal punishment for their crimes after death.\n\nHouse of Hades: A lavish estate located in the very heart of Tartarus. It is home to most of the Chthonic gods and is also where all the newly deceased souls gather to be judged by Hades personally.\n\nErebus: A dark forgotten corner of Tartarus which appears to be only accessible via an Infernal Gate, it is home to all of the mythological monsters whether evil, neutral or good who have been slain. And may also be home to the Shades who were unfortunate enough to not have any coins on them when they died, as Charon in Greek mythology would refuse to give a soul passage to the rest of the Underworld without proper payment first.\n\nNotably the Minotaur Asterius was stated to have ended up in Erebus after his death before Theseus was able to convince Hades to allow him into Elysium.\n\nIt's also implied that Charon might reside in Erebus when off duty, as whenever Zagreus tries to steal from him, the ferryman teleports them both to a specialized dojo like area in Erebus so he can beat up the prince as punishment.\n\nChaos Gates: Located even deeper than Tartarus itself, the strange realm which the primordial Chaos chooses to call home has long been a source of mystery and intrigue both among mortals and deities alike.

She is depicted unabashedly, as a voluptuous nude goddess with peach-colored eyes and a defined jawline. She is adorned on the sides of her head with decorative vegetation brooches, with jewelry intertwined on her wrists and ankles.

Her domain can cause great turbulence with more devastating consequences than a lightning bolt, literally destroying the hearts of her adversaries.\n\nHer signature Status Curse is Weak, which reduces the afflicted enemies' damage by 30%. Aphrodite also offers boons which increase the effectiveness of her Status Curse itself, such as Empty Inside (which increases the effect's duration).\n\nThe most feminine goddess of Olympus, Aphrodite exudes a confident and seductive aura and is depicted with small vegetables adorning her head. She is depicted unabashedly, as a voluptuous nude goddess with peach-colored eyes and a defined jawline. She is adorned on the sides of her head with decorative vegetation brooches, with jewelry intertwined on her wrists and ankles. Her incredible long silky peach-colored hair covers her breasts and pubic area, with its ends entwining in a heart shape.",

            "content": "Demeter is the goddess of agriculture as well as sacred law and the cycle of life and death, the giver of life and in turn, the taker of it.\n\nMany of the boons she offers to Zagreus inflict her signature Status Curse, Chill, which causes enemies to slow down and, possibly, shatter, spreading the Curse. In addition to that, she offers the 2nd highest raw percentage damage increase. Her other boons vary between helping survivability by healing, increasing damage, or boosting your different boons over time by increasing their rarity.\n\nDemeter boons excel at control, as Chill slows enemies down the more Zagreus strikes them. Since Chill is easy to stack and maintain, this also enables good synergy with the Mirror of Night Upgrade, Privileged Status.\n\nLady Demeter, the Goddess of Harvest, Agriculture, and Seasons, was once benevolent, hardworking, strong-willed, and protective. However, her pain and grief over losing her beloved daughter Persephone resulted in the infamous \"Endless Winter,\" causing her to take on a more wintry appearance and bitter personality.\n\nAs a mother, she was kind but overly controlling, keeping her daughter on a tight leash out of fear for her safety. Due to Persephone's mortal heritage, she saw her as fragile, and refused to consider her feelings, not even listening when she tried to tell her about Hades. Her overprotection led to a rift between them.\n\nDemeter's appearance is themed around winter and ebbing life. She is an elderly woman with blue lips and silvery-white hair worn in twin braids that cross her chest and loop back over the opposite shoulder. Six shoots of pale blue wheat frame her head, and she wears icicle-like earrings and ornaments that resemble snowflakes above her head. Her blue robe is flecked with a frost-like pattern on the abdomen, and her cape is made of snow with large blue snowflakes on its shoulders. Her forearms are mostly covered in ice, with only her digits and small parts of her forearms having visible skin, and she wears a small ring or bit of snow on her left ring finger. The only bits of green on her person are her eyes and the green ribbon she holds, which looks much like Persephone's hair ribbon.

In addition to that, she offers the 2nd highest raw percentage damage increase. Her other boons vary between helping survivability by healing, increasing damage, or boosting your different boons over time by increasing their rarity.\n\nDemeter boons excel at control, as Chill slows enemies down the more Zagreus strikes them. Since Chill is easy to stack and maintain, this also enables good synergy with the Mirror of Night Upgrade, Privileged Status.\n\nLady Demeter, the Goddess of Harvest, Agriculture, and Seasons, was once benevolent, hardworking, strong-willed, and protective. However, her pain and grief over losing her beloved daughter Persephone resulted in the infamous \"Endless Winter,\" causing her to take on a more wintry appearance and bitter personality.\n\nAs a mother, she was kind but overly controlling, keeping her daughter on a tight leash out of fear for her safety. Due to Persephone's mortal heritage, she saw her as fragile, and refused to consider her feelings, not even listening when she tried to tell her about Hades. Her overprotection led to a rift between them.\n\nDemeter's appearance is themed around winter and ebbing life. She is an elderly woman with blue lips and silvery-white hair worn in twin braids that cross her chest and loop back over the opposite shoulder. Six shoots of pale blue wheat frame her head, and she wears icicle-like earrings and ornaments that resemble snowflakes above her head. Her blue robe is flecked with a frost-like pattern on the abdomen, and her cape is made of snow with large blue snowflakes on its shoulders. Her forearms are mostly covered in ice, with only her digits and small parts of her forearms having visible skin, and she wears a small ring or bit of snow on her left ring finger. The only bits of green on her person are her eyes and the green ribbon she holds, which looks much like Persephone's hair ribbon. A cornucopia, covered in snow and containing no food, appears behind her.",

            "content": "Hades is the god of the Underworld and of the mineral riches of the earth, the lord and master of the House of Hades, and the father of Zagreus and Melino\u00eb. He is in charge of maintaining order within the Underworld, determining the placements and punishments of the dead, and hearing the petitions of shades that come before him.\n\nHades is stern, serious, and dedicated to his work. In the Remembrances that play before some escape attempts, he is shown to have been strict and often cruel to Zagreus during his childhood. He employed Achilles to teach Zagreus fighting and give him more of a \"firm direction in life.\" Meanwhile, Hades seems to have left much of the caretaking and raising of Zagreus to Nyx.\n\nHe is resentful of Zagreus' repeated attempts to escape the Underworld and greets his returns with scorn and mockery. Additionally, he will sometimes order shades to congregate near Zagreus to punish him with time trials or to defend his Infernal Troves, in addition to overseeing the Infernal Gates to Erebus. He berates Zagreus upon the prince managing to progress from Tartarus to Asphodel, from Asphodel to Elysium, and finally from Elysium to the Temple of Styx. After Zagreus successfully bribes Cerberus with a Satyr Sack to let him by without violence, Hades realizes that he needs to become personally involved and heads off to face Zagreus at the snowy grounds on the living side of the Temple's archway, having equipped his Helm of Darkness and his fearesome spear Gigaros, to vanquish his son and banish him back to the House. He is the final boss of the main game.\n\nThe twin-pronged Sigil of the Dead forms Hades's personal seal, appearing on his person and wargear and being widely used as a mark of cthonic power throughout the Underworld. In the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the House he is officially afforded the title of Unseen One, a ceremonial rank of immense status only achievable by Zagreus through an incredible amount of work and dedication.\n\nHades is a massive, hulking figure, significantly larger than any human. He has gray skin, red eyes with black sclera, and long, wavy, black hair. Notably, he also possesses a waist-length mustache whose two halves intersect each other across his upper chest, forming the shape of his symbol, Gigaros. He wears decadent red robes adorned with numerous pieces of golden, gem-encrusted jewelry with a skull motif. There is a flame-colored wreath laurel upon his head. Like Zagreus, Hades's bare feet emit a fiery glow and singe the ground as he walks.\n\nDespite being the main antagonist of Hades, in the end, he chooses not to reveal to Zagreus about Persephone, to protect Zagreus from his own truth and largely to avoid a civil war by Demeter, and free Persephone from all the circumstances that bind her son. Hades apologizes to his son and admits that he was a poor father.

            "entry": "Hades is the god of the Underworld and of the mineral riches of the earth, the lord and master of the House of Hades, and the father of Zagreus and Melino\u00eb. He is in charge of maintaining order within the Underworld, determining the placements and punishments of the dead, and hearing the petitions of shades that come before him.\n\nHades is stern, serious, and dedicated to his work. In the Remembrances that play before some escape attempts, he is shown to have been strict and often cruel to Zagreus during his childhood. He employed Achilles to teach Zagreus fighting and give him more of a \"firm direction in life.\" Meanwhile, Hades seems to have left much of the caretaking and raising of Zagreus to Nyx.\n\nHe is resentful of Zagreus' repeated attempts to escape the Underworld and greets his returns with scorn and mockery. Additionally, he will sometimes order shades to congregate near Zagreus to punish him with time trials or to defend his Infernal Troves, in addition to overseeing the Infernal Gates to Erebus. He berates Zagreus upon the prince managing to progress from Tartarus to Asphodel, from Asphodel to Elysium, and finally from Elysium to the Temple of Styx. After Zagreus successfully bribes Cerberus with a Satyr Sack to let him by without violence, Hades realizes that he needs to become personally involved and heads off to face Zagreus at the snowy grounds on the living side of the Temple's archway, having equipped his Helm of Darkness and his fearesome spear Gigaros, to vanquish his son and banish him back to the House. He is the final boss of the main game.\n\nThe twin-pronged Sigil of the Dead forms Hades's personal seal, appearing on his person and wargear and being widely used as a mark of cthonic power throughout the Underworld. In the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the House he is officially afforded the title of Unseen One, a ceremonial rank of immense status only achievable by Zagreus through an incredible amount of work and dedication.\n\nHades is a massive, hulking figure, significantly larger than any human. He has gray skin, red eyes with black sclera, and long, wavy, black hair. Notably, he also possesses a waist-length mustache whose two halves intersect each other across his upper chest, forming the shape of his symbol, Gigaros. He wears decadent red robes adorned with numerous pieces of golden, gem-encrusted jewelry with a skull motif. There is a flame-colored wreath laurel upon his head. Like Zagreus, Hades's bare feet emit a fiery glow and singe the ground as he walks.\n\nDespite being the main antagonist of Hades, in the end, he chooses not to reveal to Zagreus about Persephone, to protect Zagreus from his own truth and largely to avoid a civil war by Demeter, and free Persephone from all the circumstances that bind her son. Hades apologizes to his son and admits that he was a poor father. Now, with Persephone, she is able to bring out the sweeter and gentler side of Hades, leading him to be more paternal and open about his affection for him. He is still not particularly warm towards him afterward. Nevertheless, their relationship improves considerably as he is more willing to acknowledge Zagreus's positive traits and not constantly belittle him as before, sounding more like a father and son.\n\nOne might have a hard time believing so, but Hades is open to criticism and others' opinions and judgements, as evidenced by when Persephone helps him with paperwork and the fact he let Hermes influence slightly the rules of the Pact of Punishment.\n\nBefore fighting Zagreus, he also wears a long, red cape that he discards as the fight begins.

She co-rules the underworld alongside Hades and is more involved in the state of the realm itself than its inhabitants. She deeply supports Zagreus' desire to leave, and will grant him the \"Mirror of Night\", which will aid him in his quest for answers and self-discovery.\n\nAlthough the chthonic gods represent darker aspects of humanity's reflections, and for this reason the Olympians dislike Nyx and fear her, Nyx is considered benevolent, approachable, and maternal towards Zagreus. She was the first to unconditionally support him and contact the Olympian gods to help him escape. She never felt comfortable lying to him, unable to look at Zagreus without feeling guilt and responsibility for the conditions that bind him to the kingdom. It is implied that Nyx may know even more than Hades about Persephone, but cannot tell him because of Hades' prohibitions, so he will have to discover the mysteries behind his mother's disappearance and himself on his own.\n\nEven though supporting him means he will have to leave the \"flax\" and she will see him less frequently she encourages him. Nyx was able to bring him back from the dead and change his tragic fate, but that did not stop her from reprimanding him or being tough on him from time to time.

Patroclus is indifferent, stoic, and dislikes small talk. He refers to Zagreus as a \"Stranger\" and is reluctant to engage with him, initially out of apathy. Achilles explains that this is just how Patroclus is and that he has much less flattering names for people he dislikes, so Zagreus should consider it a compliment.\n\nDespite being given Achilles' place in Elysium, Patroclus emotionally rejects it and almost shuts himself off, finding his time in Elysium dull without Achilles.

Despite this, he has embraced his useless work with enthusiasm and even invaluable befriended the rock he pushes, which he nicknamed \"Bouldy,\" indicating that Sisyphus may have gone mad over time, because he is talking to a stone.\n\nThe former king is very persistent, even more than Zagreus, and his insights and advice are often helpful and greatly aid Zagreus in his escape attempts. Sisyphus provides tips whenever he can, considering Zagreus to be \"more or less\" similar to himself.

            "content": "Theseus is a former hero and king of Athens, most famous for slaying the Minotaur. He was recruited by Hades to help prevent Zagreus's escape. He fights alongside the Minotaur as the final boss of Elysium, and serves Elysium as its champion and its king.\n\nTheseus, often proclaiming himself as \"the great king of Athens,\" is a hot-headed, stubborn, and even childish ex-hero, but he is best known for his youthful exploits that were significant enough to earn him an immortal soul and boast for eternity in Elysium.\n\nTriumphant Theseus is a pompous and arrogant man, perpetually proud and confident in his victories. Most residents outside of Elysium can't stand him because of this. Theseus will occasionally shine during dialogue when he feels particularly proud of himself. The complete opposite of Achilles, Theseus is immodest and acts more like a schoolyard bully than a noble ex-hero.\n\nHe tends to interpret things to the extreme and dismiss evidence that doesn't fit his preconceived notions - thus, he will push Zagreus' buttons. In his mind, Zagreus is useless and not a true warrior, despite accumulating multiple victories against Theseus. Zagreus' attempts at conversation are taken as lies and deception, and he will not accept any provocation if Zagreus says that there are better Heroes than him.\n\nAn overly confident warrior in his winning streak, Theseus puts on a show for the crowd. He doesn't accept defeat and can behave in a dramatic and comically immature manner. When Zagreus defeats him in combat, Asterius becomes exasperated if Theseus continues to cry over Zagreus. But he has shown a noble and redeemable side, revealing that he used to be more modest, and deep down, he is a noble hero, as seen when he freed Asterius from his imprisonment and accepted him as a worthy comrade, sharing his champion title.\n\nDespite becoming a broken pedestal for Zagreus, there are enough hints scattered through dialogue that Theseus was indeed a great hero when he was still living: Hades speaks rather highly of him. Given how cynical he is, the fact that Hades continues to hold respect for him and gave him such a high station in Elysium is telling. Asterius' Undying Loyalty towards Theseus is rooted in the fact that it was thanks to Theseus that he was allowed to end up in Elysium. The Olympians offer Theseus their blessings. The Olympians are noted as being rather fickle, and despite both Poseidon and Dionysus considering Theseus to be a blowhard, they still view him as worthy of their blessings.\n\nHe and Asterius wear identical clothes, with the only difference being that Theseus keeps his left shoulder uncovered and wears a wide belt around his waist.

            "entry": "Theseus is a former hero and king of Athens, most famous for slaying the Minotaur. He was recruited by Hades to help prevent Zagreus's escape. He fights alongside the Minotaur as the final boss of Elysium, and serves Elysium as its champion and its king.\n\nTheseus, often proclaiming himself as \"the great king of Athens,\" is a hot-headed, stubborn, and even childish ex-hero, but he is best known for his youthful exploits that were significant enough to earn him an immortal soul and boast for eternity in Elysium.\n\nTriumphant Theseus is a pompous and arrogant man, perpetually proud and confident in his victories. Most residents outside of Elysium can't stand him because of this. Theseus will occasionally shine during dialogue when he feels particularly proud of himself. The complete opposite of Achilles, Theseus is immodest and acts more like a schoolyard bully than a noble ex-hero.\n\nHe tends to interpret things to the extreme and dismiss evidence that doesn't fit his preconceived notions - thus, he will push Zagreus' buttons. In his mind, Zagreus is useless and not a true warrior, despite accumulating multiple victories against Theseus. Zagreus' attempts at conversation are taken as lies and deception, and he will not accept any provocation if Zagreus says that there are better Heroes than him.\n\nAn overly confident warrior in his winning streak, Theseus puts on a show for the crowd. He doesn't accept defeat and can behave in a dramatic and comically immature manner. When Zagreus defeats him in combat, Asterius becomes exasperated if Theseus continues to cry over Zagreus. But he has shown a noble and redeemable side, revealing that he used to be more modest, and deep down, he is a noble hero, as seen when he freed Asterius from his imprisonment and accepted him as a worthy comrade, sharing his champion title.\n\nDespite becoming a broken pedestal for Zagreus, there are enough hints scattered through dialogue that Theseus was indeed a great hero when he was still living: Hades speaks rather highly of him. Given how cynical he is, the fact that Hades continues to hold respect for him and gave him such a high station in Elysium is telling. Asterius' Undying Loyalty towards Theseus is rooted in the fact that it was thanks to Theseus that he was allowed to end up in Elysium. The Olympians offer Theseus their blessings. The Olympians are noted as being rather fickle, and despite both Poseidon and Dionysus considering Theseus to be a blowhard, they still view him as worthy of their blessings.\n\nHe and Asterius wear identical clothes, with the only difference being that Theseus keeps his left shoulder uncovered and wears a wide belt around his waist. He is a muscular man who overdid the tan, his blond hair styled back (which in the past was long, similar to Achilles'), and he always maintains a confident expression on his face.

He is aided and encouraged in his journey, primarily by his caretaker Nyx and his mentor Achilles. Others outside the House of Hades, such as Sisyphus, Charon, and the Olympians sometimes offer their aid as well.\n\nZagreus is met with numerous obstacles throughout the realms of Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium, and the Temple of Styx. He is mostly faced with various aggressive shades working for his father, but he also has run-ins with the Furies (Alecto , Tisiphone and Megaera), the skeletal remains of the Lernaean Hydra, and the champion of Elysium, Theseus, and his friend, Asterius, in order to arrive at the Temple of Styx. These battles, combined with the dangerous landscape of the Underworld, serve to bring a painful end to Zagreus's escape attempts sooner or later.\n\nZagreus is the Prince of the Underworld and the rebellious son of Hades. His personality does not reflect anything from the place he comes from. Zagreus is characterized by his good humor, humility, kindness, and relentless persistence, with a tendency towards self-deprecation and a complex about the fact that he \"bleeds red.\" Having spent most of his immortal life enduring frustration and repressed anger from his toxic upbringing, Zagreus is determined and will do anything to escape his infernal prison.\n\nIn an existential crisis, Zagreus discovers that his entire life had no purpose, struggling to meet his father's expectations and feeling useless to the House for not being able to contribute to the functioning of the Underworld, feeling distant and alienated among the other inhabitants of Hades and having \"nothing to call his own.\" Despite this, he finds purpose when he discovers the existence of his true mother, long lost, Persephone, and decides to escape the realm of the dead to find answers about her and himself.\n\nZagreus is an all-loving hero, a social magnet, a charismatic, captivating, and sociable young man, who easily befriends many he encounters, treating those of lower status as equals and often using his own influence to improve their lives, respecting the elders (except his father) and other gods. He is subtle, but his gregarious attitude and desire to please everyone suggest a strong paternal void in Zagreus, a result of his emotionally distant relationship with his father. His desire to form a good relationship with everyone he meets becomes a point of the plot. Zagreus is magnetic and will make friends and allies wherever he goes, leaving a trail of tumult in the Underworld.\n\nZagreus does his best to get along with everyone and claims not to hate anyone. However, as long as they don't bother him too much like \"Theseus,\" even with Hypnos, confessing that he was mean to him, he is friendlier the next time he sees him. He is somewhat blas\u00e9, with his confident sarcasm leading him to offend those around him, often acting without thinking about the consequences. However, he always reflects on his actions and quickly apologizes when he crosses the line. Zagreus is stubborn, and his interactions with Meg and Than tend to exasperate them due to his annoying persistent escape. Zagreus is known for not taking commitments seriously, even joking about it.\n\nThough he is an elite warrior in his own right and takes enjoyment in battle, Zagreus often admits to feeling conflicted when it comes to fighting the inhabitants of the Temple of Styx. This is likely because unlike the other enemies in the game that can be fought who are already dead and will eventually regenerate after being destroyed, the Satyr Cultists and the Gigantic Vermin are still alive, and by killing them he feels that he's robbing them of their lives even though they'll all eventually end up in the Underworld anyway regardless of whether he fights them or not. This shows that while Zagreus enjoys a good fight, he takes no pleasure in the more violent aspects of combat.\n\nDue to his sheltered upbringing, Zagreus is honest and also incredibly naive and innocent about the surface world, to the point of questioning the existence of birds, relying on others to convey information, acquire knowledge, and understand the world beyond his reach.\n\nBefore gifting Zagreus his codex, Achilles makes note of Zagreus' apparent love for history. During a fight with Theseus, if a certain Pact of Punishment has been applied, he even recognizes the chariot that Theseus rides just at a glance.\n\nDue to his mortal heritage, Zagreus is somewhat small for a god, considerably shorter than Hades and about a head shorter than Persephone. Presumably, he has an average height for a mortal, as he tells the Minotaur that he is the same height as Theseus. He has heterochromia, with one eye being his father's red and the other his mother's green. His black hair is like his father's, but with his mother's spiky texture. His skin is quite pale (tanned by underworld standards), and he is physically strong and muscular. His feet are perpetually on fire. Zagreus is well-sculpted, so much so that even Aphrodite takes note of him. Although he is considered thin for a god and has been called skinny, he would be considered above average in size by mortal standards. It seems he strangely bleeds red.\n\nZagreus wears a red and black toga, hanging over his left shoulder with his right chest exposed. He also wears a white belt, visually resembling bone, with skulls carved into it. On his left shoulder is a metallic shoulder plate resembling the three heads of Cerberus biting onto his shoulder. He has red ribbons wrapped in an x-pattern on his right arm and two thin leather bracelets on his left forearm, one near his wrist and the other near his elbow. He also wears blood red trousers.

However, this is only superficially. While his brother Hades is well-intentioned and fair beneath his exterior, Zeus is the opposite. In his essence, Zeus can be quite cunning, superb, displays a superiority complex, and possibly has the most inflated ego of the Olympians.\n\nZeus tries to act like a benevolent god, but even his acts of \"kindness\" are rooted in what pleases him. He is not afraid of the consequences of his actions and never takes responsibility. He seems unable to acknowledge that he participated, does not listen to others, and is always making fun of serious matters.\n\nZeus tends to act compassionate with Zagreus, offering encouragement, but he is also somewhat self-centered. He forces everyone to say something good about him, about how he is \"the most elegant, powerful, and divine of the gods.\" and can joke about his nephew having a \"Celestial Revenge\" if he accepts another benefit.\n\nZeus can be quite cynical, like when he likes to mention Demeter's missing daughter in their family conversations and commenting blatantly about how lamentable the whole case is, while acting as if he's just as perplexed as the others. However, he is absolutely aware that he is entirely responsible for the kidnapping of Persephone. His audacity also leads him to send his nephew to send a message to his father on his behalf, saying that \"Zeus forgives him,\" maddening Hades with fury with his contradictory insolence, despite having caused the all problem in question.\n\nZeus in his splendor is not purely selfish, as he was when he saved the cosmos by waging war against the Titans and dividing the world almost fairly with his brothers. He very much wanted to reconnect with Hades and liked Zagreus, wishing him as a son. Although in the most wrong way possible, he certainly saw Persephone as a \"gift\". Zeus realized that his older brother was alone in the underworld, liked Persephone, and that she reciprocated and wanted to leave Olympus. So he staged the kidnapping with her and brought her to Hades, in part to fix things with him and reconcile, however radical the approach.\n\nZeus appears as an imposing, elderly man with a tan skin tone and a loose robe revealing his musclebound chest. His hair and beard are stark white and emulate the clouds of his heavenly domain. He is armed with his signature lightning bolt, alongside two other bolts worn in his hair as a laurel wreath.

In his essence, Zeus can be quite cunning, superb, displays a superiority complex, and possibly has the most inflated ego of the Olympians.\n\nZeus tries to act like a benevolent god, but even his acts of \"kindness\" are rooted in what pleases him. He is not afraid of the consequences of his actions and never takes responsibility. He seems unable to acknowledge that he participated, does not listen to others, and is always making fun of serious matters.\n\nZeus tends to act compassionate with Zagreus, offering encouragement, but he is also somewhat self-centered. He forces everyone to say something good about him, about how he is \"the most elegant, powerful, and divine of the gods.\" and can joke about his nephew having a \"Celestial Revenge\" if he accepts another benefit.\n\nZeus can be quite cynical, like when he likes to mention Demeter's missing daughter in their family conversations and commenting blatantly about how lamentable the whole case is, while acting as if he's just as perplexed as the others. However, he is absolutely aware that he is entirely responsible for the kidnapping of Persephone. His audacity also leads him to send his nephew to send a message to his father on his behalf, saying that \"Zeus forgives him,\" maddening Hades with fury with his contradictory insolence, despite having caused the all problem in question.\n\nZeus in his splendor is not purely selfish, as he was when he saved the cosmos by waging war against the Titans and dividing the world almost fairly with his brothers. He very much wanted to reconnect with Hades and liked Zagreus, wishing him as a son. Although in the most wrong way possible, he certainly saw Persephone as a \"gift\". Zeus realized that his older brother was alone in the underworld, liked Persephone, and that she reciprocated and wanted to leave Olympus. So he staged the kidnapping with her and brought her to Hades, in part to fix things with him and reconcile, however radical the approach.\n\nZeus appears as an imposing, elderly man with a tan skin tone and a loose robe revealing his musclebound chest. His hair and beard are stark white and emulate the clouds of his heavenly domain. He is armed with his signature lightning bolt, alongside two other bolts worn in his hair as a laurel wreath. He also adorns golden bracelets and rings.",

It is a ranged weapon modeled after a repeating rifle.\n\nThe Adamant Rail's primary attack fires bullets rapidly out of an ammo cache in the direction Zagreus is looking. These bullets do not stagger enemies or cause them to flinch, and they deal low damage. Zagreus is immobile while firing.\n\nWhen the Rail is out of ammo, it must be reloaded. It will reload automatically when releasing the attack button while out of ammo. A manual reload can be triggered with the \"Reload\" action.\n\nThe Rail's special is \"Bombard\". Using it targets an area around the cursor and launches a large grenade at it. After a brief delay, the grenade will hit the targeted area, dealing massive damage to enemies within the blast zone. The grenade will bounce back from walls and obstacles.\n\nThe Adamant Rail has 4 Aspects: Zagreus, Eris, Hestia, and Lucifer. Like all other weapons, each Aspect has 5 levels that can be unlocked by spending Titan Blood. The higher the level of the Aspect, the more effective its improvement is. Reaching the highest level in all Aspects requires 51 Titan Blood. An Aspect will not only change the appearance of the Adamant Rail but will also improve its attacks. The Aspect of Lucifer has a unique move-set that changes the fighting style of the Adamant Rail.",
